I&#39;ve mentioned it before: a law professor once told our class that the answer to any question beginning &quot;why don&#39;t they&quot; is usually &quot;money.&quot; This doesn&#39;t always apply -- for example, if you built the whole plane out of the black box, it couldn&#39;t fly. But it&#39;s generally a good starting point for looking at a hard question. Who wants to pay for the solution; who wants to have it paid for?

(another example: the Eagles did not refuse to fly to Mordor because of money; it was because it wasn&#39;t their job, and also, do you want a power-mad Eagle Ringlord? I did not think so)

I am regretting, right now, having used a &quot;why don&#39;t they just&quot; joke in any way, shape, or form in the beginning of this post. I hereby request that people consider reading and commenting on any of the links that I posted -- or lambasting me in the form of a checklist.

&quot;Your post advocates a \[( ) pessimistic ( ) self-righteous ( ) incurious ( ) cliché\] approach to squashing creative ideas. Your post is depressing and inhibiting. Here is why it contributes to a widespread feeling of helplessness and impedes efforts that actually would work.&quot;

Paraphrased from a tumblr post I once saw and cannot find again, &quot;If you feel you have to ask why everyone doesn&#39;t just, or why don&#39;t people just, then don&#39;t! Everyone has never just ever before, and no one in the future will ever just!&quot;

i&#39;ve always been a fan of &quot;how might we&quot; as a proactive and creative way to frame thinking about challenges. agreed with the sentiments in this thread that &quot;why don&#39;t they just&quot; is a cop out.

I&#39;m not sure how one makes the universal declaration that people are expected to do &quot;research&quot; before &quot;opening their trap&quot; - verbal (or written) interaction with others is a way of learning too.

I do remember very clearly seeing that spam document years ago and thinking &quot;Yeah, I guess it really is an intractable or even an unsolvable problem&quot; I&#39;m glad others didn&#39;t see it that way and instead kept working until it was largely solved (for email at least)
