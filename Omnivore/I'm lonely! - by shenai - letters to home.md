I’m writing this post at 9 PM on a Friday night, alone in my apartment, watching a YouTube stranger’s “study with me” video and listening to the score from [The Green Knight](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;open.spotify.com&#x2F;album&#x2F;4yuBusTe5rPkBCtGhfHirQ?si&#x3D;02keRek%5FSRm1q6owa3ox8w). There are dishes in the sink from the Hello Fresh two-portion meal of which I’ve only eaten half, leftovers in the fridge carefully clingwrapped for my tomorrow-self. I’ve just finished watching Caroline Winkler’s [video on being lonely](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;sRLUfnefjrs&amp;t&#x3D;689s) in your early-&#x2F;mid-twenties. And I’m lonely. It is 9 PM on a Friday night, and like so many Friday nights preceeding it, I am terribly, strangely, inexplicably, mind-numbingly lonely. 

I think it’s taboo to talk about being lonely. I think it’s difficult to talk about being lonely without coming across as though you don’t appreciate the friends and community in your life. I do! I love my friends. I love the people I chat with on a daily basis. But sometimes it feels like sand passing through a strainer, barely anything really sticking, and at the end of the night I’m left with only meager traces of the love and recognition I experienced that day. 

Though community is certainly a factor in alleviating the dreadful pall of loneliness, it’s not by any means directly responsible for whether I feel lonely or not. I can’t count how many times in my life I’ve been surrounded by people I am friendly with, and feel affection for, and have collaborated with to produce wonderful things—and felt hopelessly lonely. In fact it’s in moments like these, where I’m pressed up against the vibrant landscapes of other people’s interiority, that I often experience the strongest pangs of loneliness. Loneliness to me is wholly about not being understood, not being recognized, as well as not understanding or recognizing someone else. Do you know what I mean? I am hoping you know what I mean. Loneliness to me is about talking to someone in a dark room over drinks, or on a park bench on a summer evening, or in a car throttling down the highway, and attempting a ritual of mutual recognition, and failing. Coming so close, and then coming away feeling as though something inside you has been half-finished, or taken out and put back in the wrong place.

I am not particularly good at handling these moments of almost-connection. They feel worse to me than meeting someone on an entirely separate page from you, where you know from the get-go the stakes are low and you won’t have to attempt serious vulnerability. Oh god! It feels so bad to earnestly attempt connecting with someone, only, for one reason or another, to come away at the end of it feeling as though they didn’t recognize you, and even worse—you don’t recognize yourself. It feels awful to spend all your energy trying to ride the waves of the new dynamic, to try and attune yourself to the energy the other person is offering, to the point where you leave feeling as though you don’t understand yourself. Who was I during that interaction? I was not in my body; I was somewhere else; I was dissociating. And now, afterwards, I am by myself, trying to pick up the pieces, attempting to stitch myself into something, someone that I recognize. 

One point that I really loved in the Caroline Winkler video is how she says you don’t need to find “connection” or fulfillment in people. That often you can combat “loneliness” by investing in hobbies or work that you’re passionate about. To me this speaks to the fact that the feeling I often term “loneliness” is more precisely “lack of recognition”. And other people seeing me as I am is not the only way I can feel recognized—I can recognize _myself_ through writing; I can recognize myself through reading; I can recognize myself through programming or drawing or singing or doing yoga. 

I have always been insecure about how I am—or I perceive that—I’m not particularly good at “having lots of friends”, whatever that means. I feel insecure about the fact that I have never quite found myself in a friend group where I can spontaneously hit someone up to go get food or coffee or just hang out at their place and watch TV. On nights where I’m alone, and I’m filled with an unbearable longing to be recognized, this insecurity creeps up on me and tells me the reason I feel terrible is because I deserve to feel terrible; because I’m a nasty misanthrope that’s uniquely socially broken somehow. I know that this isn’t true, but sometimes it’s very easy to sit in a negative feeling and let it subsume you, let it tell you pretty, uncomplicated lies about the way the world is.

I think this fantasizing about being able to hang out with a random faceless, nameless person, or a platonic ideal of someone I’ve only met a few times, is also deeply ironic, because a lot of the time, even when my closest friends want to spend time with me or talk to me, I’ll be hesitant to engage in a social interaction with them because I’m too deep in the flow of what I’m working on or thinking about. I have also often felt insecure about this, so certain that there’s something wrong with me that would cause me to turn down spending time with my loved ones, but I think I am just someone that needs a lot of recognition from _myself_. 

I am trying very hard to honor this. I want to not be embarrassed about deriving a lot of my joy and nourishment from talking to myself in a text editor, or sitting in a coffee shop just staring at the wall and thinking, or reading things late at night on the couch. All of this is meaningful; all of this is real, even if others don’t witness it. I am speaking to myself and I am listening to myself and I am honoring myself.
