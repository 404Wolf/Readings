* yes it&#39;s wednesday again, maybe i should just purposely aim to always release these mid-week.
* cut out the paper pattern for my [side-tie dungarees](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etsy.com&#x2F;uk&#x2F;listing&#x2F;1515577710&#x2F;side-tie-dungarees-pattern-digital-pdf) finally. now i&#39;m worrying i did too sloppy a job as some of the sets of lines aren&#39;t perfectly overlapping where i had to tape the two a0 sheets together. the dungarees are meant to be forgiving when worn, so we&#39;ll see how forgiving sewing the pattern is of bad cutting!
* started reading the parable of the sower by octavia butler on sunday 20th as that&#39;s when the begins in the book! it&#39;s heavy and harrowing but a really gripping read, i recommend with trigger warning for sexual violence, regular violence, descriptions of torture and death so far?
* been watching the newest season of doctor who, just got to the first episode i thought was narratively passable, [Boom](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;tv-and-radio&#x2F;article&#x2F;2024&#x2F;may&#x2F;18&#x2F;doctor-who-boom-ncuti-gatwa-millie-gibson-steven-moffat-landmine-recap). ncuti gatwa and millie gibson act their asses off every episode but it&#39;s hard to fight a script!
* my video ideas have been blooming into multi-hour monsters so as I maybe said last week, parking them and trying to come up with newer, shorter ideas. marvelling that anyone has said anything interesting in 60 seconds, ever.
