UK and world premiere night for contemporary music at Barbican Hall the weekend before last as part of [LSO Futures](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lso.co.uk&#x2F;whats-on&#x2F;the-music-of-tomorrow-lso-futures&#x2F;) and ahead of each piece FX Roth asked composers in attendance on stage for a quick chat starting with a joke to break the ice. Christian Drew was given to describe mimicking underwater sound in score and Donghoon Shin had to explain how his and Unsuk Chin&#39;s surnames are pronounced differently. Also certain notations he used were found to be a bit kitsch? Then Stef Conner&#39;s tame appearance and raging death metal inspired work were exposed as frankly contrasting!

Our applause hopefully made up for some of the teasing clearly done in humor to benefit the audience. However, if that was marginally being silly among friends, since we all make projections everyday and online of course, as artist and professional alien you are regularly faced with easy judgement a fair deal. In fact, there can be no salvation from this form of control, the scholarly pursuit of advance psychologizing by process of reduction in the spirit of being deservedly on the hook for something always. Here&#39;s my personal dozen best of:

| Premise                                                      | Context                                            | Whose fault?   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Lazy, perfectionist, ergomaniac                              | Quit procrastinating, get some air                 | Mine           |
| Self involved, never listens to anyone                       | Look at you! Turn on, tune in, and cop out         | Oof            |
| Attention seeking, wants closure                             | Oh you went to school for this?                    | As above       |
| Lacks discipline, is all over the place, cannot be relied on | Wake up, get a grip, freak                         | Same           |
| Overly sensitive, weak, unable to let go, hanger-on          | This world is made of steel and concrete           | Ditto          |
| Bad relationship with money, needs lessons in capitalism     | Get a real job, loser                              | God only knows |
| Problems with sexuality, defined by                          | We know you better than you know yourself          | Guess who      |
| Naively independent, defiantly antiauthoritarian             | A boss is what you need, strip first, then we talk | All mine       |
| Poor grasp of reality, hopelessly romantic                   | Are you aware we can read faces?                   | &#39;O sole mio    |
| Wannabe, minor celebrity                                     | What was your name again?                          | Yours truly    |
| Dreamer, does not take life seriously                        | What are you a baby? Grow up already               | Myself         |
| Takes everything literally and way too seriously             | Give up or stress is going to get you              | TBD            |

We expect people to be perfect so acting and laboring in public unavoidably invites shallow perceptions, which means you are often left wondering: Who am I and what am I doing here? Because a lot of design choices involved in the production of culture center around mastery of anticipation, social expectations make for valuable material when attempting to conceptualize and to experiment with a life art in mystical tradition, but outside religion or the cult of personality.

**Scandalous beyond repair** Hard to believe standard ridicule alone could have led John Singer Sargent to give up Paris. Only a guess, but it may have been they tried to interpret his psychology by accusing him of using indecency in bid for attention that got under his skin eventually. That must have stung a little.

But then again did he change his style or quit painting? No, he just took his talents elsewhere and kept going in miraculous own it and move on fashion. Nice of him to have taken the time to paint the fallen strap back up in any case.
