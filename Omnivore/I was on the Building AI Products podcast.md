The inimitable [Raph Lee](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.raphlee.com&#x2F;?ref&#x3D;sashalaundy.com) interviewed me on the second episode of his podcast, Building AI Products. I love this podcast concept because it&#39;s about the nitty-gritty technical details of getting these products out the door‚Äîa framing I don&#39;t see talked about nearly enough. 

This is the first time I&#39;ve been interviewed about running teams and doing data work. It was really fun! I&#39;d love to do more of these. 

## Listener Feedback

My favorite part has been hearing from listeners, so if you got something out of it, I&#39;d love to [hear from you](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sashalaundy.com&#x2F;contact&#x2F;)! So far I&#39;ve heard: 

* a lot of followup questions about using the Shape Up framework to structure and prioritize work
* &quot;it&#39;s really interesting how you use [design thinking](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dschool.stanford.edu&#x2F;resources&#x2F;getting-started-with-design-thinking?ref&#x3D;sashalaundy.com) to hone the scope of machine learning products. I&#39;m user researcher and didn&#39;t realize my skills could be used that way.&quot;
* &quot;I will literally use this tomorrow!!&quot; and then when I followed up a couple days later: &quot;I showed this to my boss, and we used the questions to guide a stakeholder away from a dashboard they were requesting, but didn&#39;t actually need. We built them something better.&quot; Add 1 to my running Misguided Dashboard Kill Count, please and thank you üèÜ

## Show Notes

&gt; Sasha is one of those wonderful high-IQ, high-EQ, left-right-brained people who&#39;s both super technical and a great people manager.
&gt; 
&gt; At Warby Parker, she ran a centralized team that did statistical modeling, BI training and analyst support, and machine learning.
&gt; 
&gt; In this episode, we discuss:
&gt; 
&gt; üëì Shape Up, a framework for shipping in six-week cycles that turns out to be perfect for data science teams
&gt; 
&gt; üëì Powerful questions to build the right thing for stakeholders, especially stakeholders who don&#39;t &quot;speak data&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; üëì Why everyone asks for a dashboard, but nobody actually needs one
&gt; 
&gt; üëì How a centralized team of data scientists can work with data analysts embedded in vertical business teams
