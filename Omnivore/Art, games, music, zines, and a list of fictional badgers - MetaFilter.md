The blogging platform Cohost ([previously](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metafilter.com&#x2F;197361&#x2F;Cohost-a-new-social-media-site)) has launched a new section: [Artist Alley](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cohost.org&#x2F;rc&#x2F;artist-alley), where members pay to advertise their podcasts, zines, art, games, and other creations (many of which are free to enjoy). Or sometimes members advertise just to play around - the &quot;#doing a bit&quot; tag is replete with Rickrolling, &quot;Hey check out this picture of a pileated woodpecker I took&quot;, a silly survey, etc. Artist Alley is [&quot;a take on user-to-user ads we feel good about â€” a dedicated space which users can access to see promotions from other users, like an artist alley at a convention&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cohost.org&#x2F;staff&#x2F;post&#x2F;5101727-end-of-week-financia) and &quot;a revenue product&quot; for Cohost, which [had a poor financial forecast](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cohost.org&#x2F;staff&#x2F;post&#x2F;5023717-march-2024-financial) in March which [has since improved](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cohost.org&#x2F;staff&#x2F;post&#x2F;5811978-april-2024-mini-upda).
