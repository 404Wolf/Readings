Back at the grind after a wonderful week off in the Bahamas. I got sick for a few days after getting home, but still [#happy](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writing.natwelch.com&#x2F;tag&#x2F;happy) so can&#39;t complain. Lots of traveling in the coming weeks: Headed to SF tomorrow for a few days. Then London on the 11th for a few days as well!

Watch

* Melissa and I have been on a bit of animated movie kick lately. We watched Shrek, Tangled, and Zootopia. All hold up realy well and are a delight to watch.

Listen

* [Chet Faker @ TheLotRadio 01-29-2024](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;cT8i4E4NYXs) is a great set of unreleased music from him. Very chill listening.
* [Can you patent a pizza?](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gastropod.com&#x2F;can-you-patent-a-pizza&#x2F;) is a great episode of Gastropod about the history of stuffed crust pizza and the patenting of food.
* [Decoder interview with Bluesky CEO Jay Graber](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;3&#x2F;25&#x2F;24108872&#x2F;bluesky-ceo-graber-federation-social-media-decoder-interview) is a great interview and made me want to investigate Bluesky and their AT protocol more.

Read

* Caught up on my manga this week. Read the latest volumes of [Spy x Family](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.viz.com&#x2F;spy-x-family), [Call of the Night](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.viz.com&#x2F;call-of-the-night), and [Blue Lock](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blue%5FLock). They aren&#39;t perfect, but they are all fun reads.

Play

* I tried out [F1 23](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;F1%5F23) and boy is it terrible. It was free on PlayStation, so I tried it out. Not for me. So for now I&#39;ll continue working on Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Libery and Baulder&#39;s Gate 3.

I hope you have a great week!
