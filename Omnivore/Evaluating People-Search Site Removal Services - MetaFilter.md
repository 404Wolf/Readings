New _Consumer Reports_ study on getting your address, phone number, etc. removed from sites like Spokeo: [&quot;Data Defense: Evaluating People-Search Site Removal Services&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;innovation.consumerreports.org&#x2F;new-report-data-defense-evaluating-people-search-site-removal-services&#x2F;). &quot;a group of companies offers to remove peopleâ€™s personal data from people-search sites for fees ranging from $19.99 per year to more than $1,000 per year...&quot; They tested 7 removal services to try to delete participant info from 13 people-search sites. While the study&#39;s authors &quot;do not consider the results statistically significant or nationally representative&quot;, they found that &quot;As a whole, people-search removal services are largely ineffective.&quot; and &quot;Manual opt-outs were more effective than people-search removal services but were also far from perfect.&quot; ([19-page PDF](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;innovation.consumerreports.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2024&#x2F;08&#x2F;Data-Defense%5F-Evaluating-People-Search-Site-Removal-Services-.pdf) including Methodology and Limitations sections.)
