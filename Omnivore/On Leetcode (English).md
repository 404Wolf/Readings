&gt; You can read this original article [in Grugspeak here](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elijer.github.io&#x2F;garden&#x2F;devnotes&#x2F;LeetCode-Journal&#x2F;On-Leetcode-%28Grugspeak%29).

I think leetcode is helpful. I believe it has helped me grow a ton as a programmer, will continue to aid my growth as a programmer, and this is true for all programmers. I also think that, if approached in certain ways, leetcode can be powerfully destructive. [The first 12 minutes of this 18 minute video by Leetcode.IO really supported my experience](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;aHZW7TuY%5Fyo)and helped me to process a lot of my thoughts about leetcode into a really simple premise; leetcode is _mostly_ about practice.

A common critique of leetcode that it isn’t what coding at a job is like at all, and although I think this is true and a helpful point to make, I don’t totally agree that this disqualifies leetcode as a helpful method for becoming a better programmer.

Leetcode taught me that even in a language that I have been using for more than five years, Javascript, there are still many basic things I either don’t know, or have _known_ briefly but failed to internalize, and the true cost of that ignorance.

In other words, leetcode has been a powerful tool for teaching me what I didn’t know I didn’t know.

It also provided me with the soft skill of working under pressure - this can be accomplished in other ways, but one of the tricky things about leetcode is that it represents an (arguably) inexhaustible source of pressure and mindfuckery, which is exactly the on-tap kind of resource you need to continually practice coding under pressure.

Here’s a list of some of the things I learned from leetcod3:

* Write code too fast and you make mistakes that slow you down in the long run
* Code too _slowly_ and you lose valuable time to refine _actual code_
* Pseudocode can be really helpful
* If consider alternate approaches only takes 40 seconds, it might be worth stepping back and doing that
* Committing to any direction is always better than “hmm, what’s a better way to do this”
* when to use &#x60;for...in&#x60; and when to use &#x60;for...of&#x60;
* When to use &#x60;Object.entries()&#x60;, vs &#x60;Object.keys()&#x60;
* This fuzzy strategy of how if you _save_ things as you iterate, it can prevent you from needing to iterate a second time
* How time complexity really works (50% of the way there at least if we’re being honest)
* That math notation exists (time complexity is responsible for this)
* What _space_ complexity is
* How trees can be helpful when doing various spatial lookups, like for a game
* How &#x60;const&#x60; really can help prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot sometimes
* How typing, when it comes to handling nulls, is one of the easiest ways to prevent unexpected errors

I think it’s cool how these lessons range from really technical, language-specific insights to much broader insights about weak-spots in my process.

I also happen to be someone who has built a _lot_ of personal projects from the ground up, so I suppose I’m pretty experience in just hacking things together and learning what makes sense in an ecosystem on my own. That’s probably why leetcode is so good for me - I’ve spent a lot of time just doing what _works_ rather than really heads-down learning the best practices for syntax and algorithms, since I can usually borrow those form someone when shit really hits the fan.

What I _didn’t_ realize was that the cost of sub-par code throughout my repos, in terms of the details, really slows me down.
