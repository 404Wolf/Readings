Content warning  CW: discussion of racism

Coming into this from _Don&#39;t Let Me Be Lonely_, I was a little disappointed, but it&#39;s still quiet good.

It is a little strange reading this a decade after it came out, the same conversations it&#39;s embedded in continuing to loop today, nothing really seeming to improve. It&#39;s easy to imagine extending this book with the handful of new instances of racism that happened to become news cycles, and ending it the same way. Depressing, but I think partially that cyclic nature is what the book is about.
