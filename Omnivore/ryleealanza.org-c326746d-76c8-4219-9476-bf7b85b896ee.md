A “weeknote”, I am told, is best written on a Friday, and yet here I am putting this second one up on Sunday night. I am sovereign of my domain name, I shall do as I see fit.

* Like 15 people came out to my show last Saturday expressly to see me perform?
* I&#39;m thoroughly touched. I haven&#39;t had that many people show up for me since college.
* I&#39;m writing &#x2F; performing music for a play that will be put on in November that my friend Raymond wrote and is producing &#x2F; directing.
* The name of the play is “The Play About The Blowjob”, and our first rehearsal was this afternoon.
* It was so fun! I read for one of the characters that doesn’t at the moment have an actor and had a blast.
* My cat Nastya is so loved. She might not be around for much longer.
* I worked and reworked at the way TUI interaction feels all this week.
* Realized that rather than “entities”, what I wanted was “events”, which can be both posted and handler registered for.
* So put together a “pub-sub” model inspired by &#x60;mediator_lua&#x60;.
* This system is really great, especially that it’s accessible from basically anywhere.
