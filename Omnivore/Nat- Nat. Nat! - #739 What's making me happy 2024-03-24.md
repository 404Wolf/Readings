Here&#39;s another [#happy](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writing.natwelch.com&#x2F;tag&#x2F;happy) post for you! I wrote this from the sunny shores of the Bahamas, so I&#39;m doing particularly well.

Watch

* [Hong Kongâ€™s Legendary Whole-Roasted Goose](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;-XtYJz3uwW0?si&#x3D;u-h%5FAR%5FqGT851cdy) is so fascinating. Street Eats by Bon AppÃ©tit continues to impress me.

Listen

* [The Sunday Story: Answering Your Questions About Electric Vehicles](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;24&#x2F;1198911299&#x2F;answering-your-questions-about-electric-vehicles) is a fantastic episode of the NPR Sunday Story. I learned a lot about electric vehicles and it challenged a few misconceptions I had about EV production in the US.
* [How to DIY a Music Career (with Amelia Meath and David Gray at SXSW)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;switchedonpop.com&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;amelia-meath-david-gray-sxsw) is a great interview with Amelia Meath of Sylvan Esso. I love hearing about how musicians think about their careers. Also learned a bunch about David Gray&#39;s song Babylon.

Read

* I enjoyed the short post &quot;[Dear Paul Graham, there is no cookie banner law](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazingcto.com&#x2F;cookie-banners-are-not-needed&#x2F;).&quot; I feel like I gave up on this fight ten years ago, but glad to see some folks are still at it.
* I read all of [The Sword of Kaigen](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;41886271) by M.L. Wang. I was gifted this book by my friend Frankie and it is not at all what I expected. Is it a political thriller? A reimagining of The Last Airbender? A treatise on the dangers of propaganda? A character study on women in bad marriages? I think it&#39;s all of these things and more. It could have been 30% shorter, but it is beautifully written and I&#39;d recommend to anyone who likes a bit of epic fantasy.
* [FlightRadar describes their new GPS Jamming Map](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flightradar24.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;gps-jamming-map&#x2F;) is pretty interesting.
* [Dan Luu&#39;s Slow Device](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;slow-device&#x2F;) writeup is super fascinating and very infuriating when you think about all of the companies that don&#39;t build for less powerful devices.
* I&#39;ve had a few times in my career where I&#39;ve pushed back against folks using websockets. [This article](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rxdb.info&#x2F;articles&#x2F;websockets-sse-polling-webrtc-webtransport.html) provides a great analysis of when to use which technology and lines up with my normal arguments.

Play

* I added [a theme switcher](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;icco&#x2F;writing&#x2F;pull&#x2F;476) and [emoji](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;icco&#x2F;writing&#x2F;pull&#x2F;582) support to my website! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸš€

I hope you have a great week!
