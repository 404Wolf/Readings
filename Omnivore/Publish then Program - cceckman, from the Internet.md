When I started at [Recurse](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recurse.com&#x2F;scout&#x2F;click?t&#x3D;8238c6d9149cbd0865752e535795d509), one of my goals was to write more, and more regularly, particularly on my personal site. But I knew I’d be tempted to spend time tweaking the site’s appearance and technologies rather than actually writing.

So I set myself a rule:

&gt; I can only spend time on the _implementation_ of my site after spending an equal amount of time on _published writing_.

![Illustration of this rule. In order: a pencil; a computer reading &#39;new post&#39;; and references to HTML, CSS and Javascript.](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app&#x2F;0x0,sn2bBR9dd5K2cdgDW1c65bXnLjEOcE_3XeXRqiGoEfzk&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cceckman.com&#x2F;writing&#x2F;publish-then-program&#x2F;illustration.svg) 

The idea is something like a bank account, or [RSU](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;r&#x2F;restricted-stock-unit.asp), or similar.

1. I spend X minutes writing an article.
2. When I _publish_ that article, those X minutes “vest”.
3. I now can spend X minutes on my site’s style, serving, etc.

Unpublished drafts don’t count! I only get credit for what other people can see.

There’s a nice little reinforcement loop here. Once I’ve built up and used a little “credit”, I can write about the improvements and recoup the “cost”. For instance, this post on [dark mode](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cceckman.com&#x2F;writing&#x2F;dark-mode&#x2F;) got me back some of the time I spent writing it.[1](#fn:1)

## Is there an app for that?

I had the thought to implement the accounting within my blog: include a little [front matter](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gohugo.io&#x2F;content-management&#x2F;front-matter&#x2F;) tracking writing time for each article, sum over published articles, and separately track the time spent on non-writing work.

But [Elias](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mulias.github.io&#x2F;) pointed out: I should only spend as much time on that functionality as I spend on _the article describing it_. After all, the accounting function would be part of “the blogging software” too!

With that in mind, I’m not actually tracking the “balance” at the moment; I’m just using ~~vibes~~ estimates. But if you try out this habit and like it, we could pair on a tracker – let me know your thoughts!

1. Of course, the risk is that [I write _only_ “how I built this site” posts](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rakhim.org&#x2F;honestly-undefined&#x2F;19&#x2F;) (thanks to Rachel Petacat for finding that comic!). As long as it takes me less time to write about The Thing than it takes to do The Thing, I think I’m okay. [↩︎](#fnref:1)
