* applied for [a rhizome microgrant](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rhizome.org&#x2F;editorial&#x2F;2024&#x2F;aug&#x2F;19&#x2F;microgrants-2024&#x2F;) today! there&#39;s still a little time if you want to.
* signed up to do [100 days of notetaking](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;biancapereira.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;100-days-of-note-taking). you should join me if you also wish that you wrote things down, or you want to have more ideas!!
* yes, neither were last week but i think when you aren&#39;t posting these on a regular cadence&#x2F;are a human weeks often blur into one solid mass without careful attention, so I&#39;m allowing things to flow a little more. anything that happened after last week&#39;s entry is fair game.
* did i tell you i&#39;m giving a talk? [be there or be square](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webdevconf.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;2024&#x2F;), i&#39;ll be talking about building better webs.
* i find it wonderful that online friends have started sending me memes about undersea cables. i love them (the friends and the cables).

![at the top half of the meme, there&#39;s a swimming shark in the sea and the words &quot;he doesn&#39;t know what the internet is&quot;. the bottom half of the meme has a shark biting a subsea cable and says &quot;but he knows what it tastes like&quot;.](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app&#x2F;0x0,sns6Az8TiGE0bAc1ylk1kdHsvclsMtH14NA1wUDvkkLI&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com&#x2F;oluonline&#x2F;shark-cables.png)

* sorta back on the chessmaxxing train. at the very least i don&#39;t find chess distressing to contemplate + am trying to get better again. if you want to play i&#39;m oluonline on chess.com and also terrible (hi terrible, i&#39;m dad). i had my first ranked game since being back to it, i play 30 min games, and my opponent told me to hurry up. then my laptop shut down due to forgetting to charge it before getting immersed and i lost for leaving the game. auspicious!
* experimenting with bookmarking tools and like [are.na](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;are.na&#x2F;) a lot! [here&#39;s my profile](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.are.na&#x2F;olu-niyi-awosusi&#x2F;all) on there too!
