New Jeans

## New Jeans

üê∞ my favorite hit track

I&#39;ve got to tell you all about this Kpop group I&#39;ve been obsessed with. Okay, so I&#39;m not usually that into Kpop, but New Jeans has totally blown me away. Plus, I&#39;m gonna talk about this lawsuit going on between New Jeans&#39; producer and Hybe that will really impact New Jeans&#39; future. (which is tragic for a fan like me)

### Who are they?

![newjeans2 alt &gt;&lt;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app&#x2F;0x0,s26vfaj-NIIkBFIMR-f7WsJzhE2nX-sBW25BI7z9WQNQ&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jinnycho&#x2F;jinnycho.github.io&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;src&#x2F;assets&#x2F;photos&#x2F;newjeans2.gif?raw&#x3D;true)

Since their debut in July 2022, New Jeans has been sensational. They first grabbed people&#39;s attention for being the first girl group put together by Heejin Min, one of Korea&#39;s most successful producers. But then their music, especially tracks like &quot;Attention&quot; and &quot;Hype Boy,&quot; and literally everything about them (dance, fashion, collabs with big companies etc) made every Korean fall in love with them pretty immediately. What&#39;s pretty cool is that their popularity also comes from the whole Y2K vibe they&#39;ve got going on, which has helped them connect with fans ranging from teenagers to people in their 30s and 40s.

And of course, they&#39;ve been taking over the world! Less than a year after debuting, they were already killing it as the most streamed female Kpop act on Spotify in the US, top 10 artists on China&#39;s QQ Music charts, and they were the first international group to be nominated and awarded for the Japan Record Award. That&#39;s huge! Oh, and let&#39;s not forget they got invited to perform at Lollapalooza with a massive crowd of 70,000 people showing up just for them and Tokyo Rock Festival where 30,000 people showed up at &quot;noon&quot; in scorching summer weather. Now they&#39;re even planning a fan meeting at Tokyo Dome, which is pretty much unheard of for a group that&#39;s only been around for like two years and hasn&#39;t even officially debuted in Japan yet.

Each member is Minji (Korean), Danielle (Korean Australian), Hyerin (Korean), Hani (Vietnamese Australian), Hyein (Korean). Go Korea and Australia!

### Music

:D I&#39;ll share some of my favorite tracks!

#### (1) Attention

#### (2) OMG

#### (3) Get Up

#### (4) Hurt

&quot;Super Shy,&quot; &quot;Ditto,&quot; &quot;Hype Boy,&quot; &quot;New Jeans&quot;, &quot;ASAP&quot;, etc - every single one is a total jam. Also there&#39;s a new album release very soon!

### What&#39;s the lawsuit again?

So, New Jeans is under this company called Ador, an independent label under Hybe, the folks behind BTS. NewJeans is the only group Ador manages. Heejin Min has been running Ador but also has legal ties with Hybe. Ador&#39;s basically 20% owned by Min and 80% by Hybe. Recently, Hybe sued Min, accusing her of trying to wreck the company and take New Jeans out of Hybe.

The whole media villainized Min until she hit back with a press release that spilled the beans on all the bad stuff Hybe, and particularly Bang, the BTS producer, did. They pretty much neglected New Jeans when they debuted‚Äîno showcase, which is usually a big deal for Kpop debuts (though they apparently didn&#39;t need it üí™). They even made New Jeans the second girl group to launch after Le Sserafim, breaking their initial promise to launch New Jeans first. And that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg. There were a bunch of legal contract issues and Hybe kept throwing shade at New Jeans‚Äô success. There‚Äôs also this wild rumor going around that Hybe has some cult connections and they were pressuring New Jeans to be more in line with the &quot;values&quot; they believe in. And some people say that Min fought back by putting out this [music video for ‚ÄúOMG‚Äù](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;%5FZAgIHmHLdc&amp;ab%5Fchannel&#x3D;HYBELABELS) to kind of mock the whole thing.

HYBE seems to want to fire Min and take full control of the company (Ador) and NewJeans. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s going to be any good for HYBE or NewJeans themselves though.

### Ending

I just purely like and respect Min and New Jeans. Min proved herself an extremely talented producer once again. New Jeans is an edgy and inspiring piece of art who can sing, dance and ultimately make people happy. I can&#39;t wait to go to their world tour, ideally led by Min.
