Daniel Davies is a finance expert, journalist, and [former investment banker](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;16&#x2F;the-end-of-a-glittering-career&#x2F;) whose writing I&#39;ve been reading for over 20 years on [Crooked Timber](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;author&#x2F;daniel&#x2F;) and on [his own blog](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.danieldavies.com&#x2F;) as well as elsewhere. Sometimes he writes analogies, games, or flights of fancy to help readers think about complex issues more clearly.

Davies has written for [_The Guardian_](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;profile&#x2F;danieldavies) ([example](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;2009&#x2F;jan&#x2F;23&#x2F;runnymede-trust-working-class-regional-accents)), _The New Yorker_ ([example](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;currency&#x2F;is-wall-street-really-robbing-new-york-citys-pension-funds)), the _Financial Times_ ([&quot;Towards a theory of co-headship: A detailed taxonomy of management company rationales for this weird Wall Street anomaly&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;2ba20e5d-c8ea-4b7c-8768-88b3cc18615d), this month), the _Washington Post_ ([example](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;2023&#x2F;03&#x2F;16&#x2F;credit-suisse-silicon-valley-bank-client-control&#x2F;?s&#x3D;09)), and several other venues. And he&#39;s been prolific as well [on his Substack](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;backofmind.substack.com&#x2F;about) newsletter, on [Medium](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@dsquareddigest), on [Twitter](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dsquareddigest), on [Bluesky](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bsky.app&#x2F;profile&#x2F;dsquareddigest.bsky.social), and probably elsewhere. And he&#39;s written multiple books; I particularly recommend his _Lying for Money_, a history of fraud.

As far as I know, there isn&#39;t one comprehensive bibliography of his work anywhere, and I was thinking of curating one, but he&#39;s written so much in so many places that it would have taken even more time than I took compiling similar finding aids for work by [Jon Bois](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metafilter.com&#x2F;171102&#x2F;Boisebration) and [Sarah Taber](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metafilter.com&#x2F;178181&#x2F;Intersectional-sustainable-crop-science-and-GIFs). So, instead, I want to share a few perhaps-representative tastes and starting points. I thought this would be one big post but instead I&#39;m planning to make a few different front page posts, on different themes, as I compile stuff.

**Choose Your Own Policy Adventure**

One interesting thing he&#39;s done a couple times is write a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-style interactive fiction experience to put you in the shoes of an expert trying to save a country&#39;s economy from a crash.

[&quot;So, what would your plan for Greece be?&quot; (2012)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2012&#x2F;02&#x2F;16&#x2F;so-what-would-your-plan-for-greece-be&#x2F;) ([previously](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metafilter.com&#x2F;112866&#x2F;Choose-Your-Own-Greek-Fiscal-Adventure)):

&gt; Reading the media and blogs, it seems to me that left and right are united in the view that the Greek default is being handled appallingly, that the current attempts at a solution are childishly obviously wrong and that everything is the fault of someone, probably the Germans. My own view – that it is not at all clear what the direction of policy is, and that although I don’t agree with the troika plan, it’s recognizable as a good-faith plan made by conscientious international civil servants working under unimaginably difficult political constraints in an economic context that was irreparably broken before they got there – is, as always, unpopular.
&gt; 
&gt; I don’t have a solution myself – the more I end up discussing this with people, the more I am reminded of the London Business School proverb taught on some of the gnarlier case studies, which is “Not All Business Problems Have Solutions”. So, CT hivemind, what do you think the best outcome is? Below the fold, I note some talking points, aimed at preventing our commentariat from falling into some of the pitfalls and mistakes which appear to be dominating debate at present. Because the whole issue is a twisty turny maze which at times seems to consist of nothing but false moves, I am presenting it in the form of a “Choose Your Own Adventure” book. I would note at this stage that I could probably have presented it in a funky HTML way rather than making you scroll up and down, but I have convinced myself that this is a feature rather than a bug – the medium matches the message here, because international debt negotiations are cumbersome, inconvenient and irritating too. Also, it is probably easier than it needs to be for readers to end up at the wrong paragraph and get a confusing jumbled narrative which bears little resemblance to the decisions they thought they’d made. Again, this is a crucial part of giving you the authentic international financial diplomacy experience.

Followup&#x2F;writer&#39;s commentary: [&quot;&#39;Who’s In Charge Here&#39; by Alan Beattie – A Field Guide To Maynards&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2012&#x2F;03&#x2F;07&#x2F;whos-in-charge-here-by-alan-beattie-a-field-guide-to-maynards&#x2F;):

&gt; I will now review that book in the &#39;London Review of Books style&#39; – ie, by writing an essay on a tangential subject of interest to myself, and then tacking on a paragraph or so about the book at the end....
&gt; 
&gt; One of the motivations for the post was a discussion I had with @PabloK on twitter about the Greek negotiations, in which he said, rather succinctly, that the purpose of protest was to change the space of what was politically possible. I think this is a crucial point; although it is important to make a good faith attempt to understand the constraints that people work under (which is why I wrote the post), it is equally important not to regard those constraints as necessarily being imposed by Ultimate Reality.

His followup game, [&quot;What would you do: Part 2, the Island of Surpyc&quot; (2013)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2013&#x2F;03&#x2F;19&#x2F;what-would-you-do-part-2-the-island-of-surpyc&#x2F;): &quot;Once more, I’m trying to help people understand how policies get made from the inside, and how something that looks like a dumb idea can often be the best choice out of a bad decision set, in the context of the ongoing Euro crisis.&quot;

**&quot;Christmas sermons&quot;**

Davies used to regularly post in December with allusive narratives or philosophical digressions on more evergreen topics.

[&quot;The future is a shoe being thrown at a human face – _forever_!&quot; (2008)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2008&#x2F;12&#x2F;23&#x2F;the-future-is-a-shoe-being-thrown-at-a-human-face-forever&#x2F;), on statistics and the &quot;difference between a historical and a statistical mode of thinking&quot;:

&gt; As you can see above, in order to get to my table of dangerous jobs, I had to make a lot of very arguable coding decisions which had a material effect on the relative positions (as far as I can see, no matter how I cut the numbers, I couldn’t have got the political and spiritual leaders down to the level of Pacific Northwest crab fishermen, but by making different judgement calls, I could certainly have made “Pope” look a lot safer).

[&quot;I don’t mind who writes the laws of the future, if I can write and sing the theme tune&quot; (2009)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2009&#x2F;12&#x2F;22&#x2F;i-dont-mind-who-writes-the-laws-of-the-future-if-i-can-write-and-sing-the-theme-tune&#x2F;): &quot;...the whole point about postmodernism is not that all interpretations are as good as any others, it’s about recognising that the choice of &#39;mood music&#39; is at least as important as the physical facts of what happened...&quot;

[&quot;The Great Homeopathic Cocktail Bar&quot; (2010)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2010&#x2F;12&#x2F;22&#x2F;the-christmas-sermon&#x2F;): &quot;is there an important point to be made here about the nature of risk and reward? Probably not, but there’s a sort of semi-attached one.&quot;

[“On Not Believing In Canada” (2012)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2012&#x2F;12&#x2F;21&#x2F;the-christmas-sermon-2012-on-not-believing-in-canada&#x2F;): &quot;on evidence, disagreement, knowledge and related matters&quot;

[&quot;The biggest game in town (2013)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2013&#x2F;12&#x2F;24&#x2F;the-biggest-game-in-town&#x2F;): &quot;I thought I might have a go at explaining one of the phenomena of online political debate which is as persistent as it is puzzling – that is to say, why does everything end up turning into a flamewar about Israel?&quot;

**Other analogies**

[&quot;Oranges and lemons – fairness intuitions and &#39;best execution&#39;&quot; (2014)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;11&#x2F;13&#x2F;oranges-and-lemons-fairness-intuitions-and-best-execution&#x2F;): &quot;Your customer is waiting back at your gate. He gives you your ten pence, and asks &#39;How much did my oranges cost?&#39; What do you tell him?&quot;

And an old favorite, [&quot;Vans-O-Doom&quot; (2003)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.danieldavies.com&#x2F;2003&#x2F;06&#x2F;vans-o-doom-once-more-i-think-that-d2d.html), on &quot;the fact that the 25,000 litres of anthrax we were promised have proved so elusive&quot;:

&gt; For reference, I went on holiday to France last year, staying in a rented villa outside Biarritz that was roughly the size of three Routemaster buses. Based on &quot;intelligence reports&quot; established by phoning the proprietor ahead of time, I managed to find it in a mere six hours despite the fact that my key &quot;source&quot; was unreliable on a number of important points, such as which exit from the fucking autoroute he was near..... after a mere four of these six hours, Mrs. Digest was loudly denouncing my abilities and, specifically, strongly suggesting that I&#39;d never actually phoned the bloke like I said I was going to and was making it up as I went along. If I&#39;d raised the objection that &quot;you can&#39;t expect me to find such a comparatively small and easily concealed object immediately in a country the size of France&quot;, I daresay I might not be alive today. 
&gt; 
&gt; If it was six weeks later and we were still motoring round the Pyrenees aimlessly keeping an eye out for anything looking likely and all we&#39;d turned up was a recently disinfected public toilet that sort of looked like it might have been rented out to foreigners once, I think any divorce court in the land would have taken it as read that my claim to have &quot;solid information&quot; about our holiday home was an outright lie. As I&#39;ve said before, if you try to analogise these great matters of state to your daily life, it makes it a lot easier to work out whether what you&#39;re being asked to believe is credible or not..... It was a specific claim and it has to be backed up specifically or not at all. In other words, I am unlikely to look favourably on any candidate _causus belli_ which contains fewer actual toxic germs than my breadbin.
