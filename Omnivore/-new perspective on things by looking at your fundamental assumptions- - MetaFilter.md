Continuing my [series](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metafilter.com&#x2F;202886&#x2F;try-to-analogise-these-great-matters-of-state-to-your-daily-life) curating work by finance expert Daniel Davies, some of his commentary on [travel](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;26&#x2F;the-world-is-squared-episode-1-switzerland-country-of-joyce&#x2F;), Ezra Pound, coffee, and the culture of the Internet and how to manage one&#39;s equanimity while writing for strangers.

**Cultural commentary**

[&quot;Wall Street&quot; (2003)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2003&#x2F;07&#x2F;21&#x2F;wall-street&#x2F;): Davies analyzes the 1987 film _Wall Street_ to propose: &quot;very few of the actions which bring down the whole house of cards on Bud Fox and Gordon Gekko were actually illegal under securities law at the time. In fact, I’d make a case that any sequel to this film would have to start with the premise that Gordon Gekko was acquitted on all charges of securities fraud.&quot;

[&quot;The Economics of Pound&#39;s Canto 45&quot; (2003)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.danieldavies.com&#x2F;2003&#x2F;02&#x2F;economics-of-pounds-canto-45-it.html) is an analysis of the poem &quot;With Usura&quot;. &quot;Canto 45 is clearly not just an economic argument, but equally clearly it is an economics argument. It makes a difference in one&#39;s reading of the poem and its imagery if you know the kind of economic worldview that it is supporting.&quot; \[Note that, in arguing **against** Pound&#39;s anti-Semitism, Davies has a sarcastic sentence or two that don&#39;t read well; [Davies has acknowledged that some of his pre-2014 writing doesn&#39;t reflect his values &amp; understanding now](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bsky.app&#x2F;profile&#x2F;dsquareddigest.bsky.social&#x2F;post&#x2F;3knjrie5igq2h).\]

As mentioned in comments in yesterday&#39;s post, [in 2003 Davies reflected on having spent a while reading and summarizing another blogger&#39;s work](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.danieldavies.com&#x2F;2003&#x2F;02&#x2F;coffee-break-length-steven-den-beste.html). He says some interesting things about Starbucks and the role of coffee culture in current political thought, and:

&gt; I found myself ruminating about geek culture, science fiction and right wing politics a lot over the last couple of weeks. One thing I&#39;d note is that the defining characteristic of science fiction is that it&#39;s escapist; it invites the reader to imagine himself in the place of the characters in the novel. Compare that to, for example, Jane Austen, where the invitation is to empathise with the reactions and feelings of one of the characters _as themselves_, rather than imaging how you might react if you were Elizabeth Darcy. This is at the root of my dissatisfaction with even left wing techno-types; they don&#39;t seem to have developed the capacity to imagine a scene or way of life without putting themselves in it; to consider what it would be like to see the world through someone else&#39;s eyes, rather than being in someone else&#39;s situation with their own set of values and judgements. And I think that this failure of imagination, or something like it, is at the root of the problem of what I find bothersome about USS Clueless.....
&gt; 
&gt; Cultures have, as a matter of extermely arguable historical fact, been brought down by overindulgence in their drug of choice... I really worry, on quiet nights with a glass of wine in my hand and looking out at the stars over London ... am I going to be part of the generation that ends up having to deal with the geopolitical consequences of the world&#39;s greatest superpower (a superpower which has always had a very problematic relationship with drugs) finally finding a chemical it truly wants to get fucked up on? 

**Travel**

Around 2014-2015 Davies and his family travelled together for, I think, about a year, around the globe. He wrote some travelogue posts and never quite finished the series, I believe. From Europe through the Polynesian Islands:

[&quot;One thing that you tend to pick up pretty soon when working for a Swiss company, unless you are very unobservant indeed, is that the senior Swiss guys all know each other because they’re all in the Army together.&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;26&#x2F;the-world-is-squared-episode-1-switzerland-country-of-joyce&#x2F;)

[&quot;On the Italian side of Mont Blanc, there is a smaller monument than the official one to the tunnel fire victims.&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;09&#x2F;15&#x2F;the-world-is-squared-episode-2-days-on-the-roof-of-europe&#x2F;)

[&quot;I can work out Greek words phonetically, as long as they stick to using letters that are also the names of important physical constants or option pricing parameters.&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;10&#x2F;11&#x2F;the-world-is-squared-episode-3-the-greek-calends&#x2F;)

[&quot;I wonder what the Nabateans would have said about the sunk-cost fallacy, because heaven knows, there are some majestic sunk costs there.&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;11&#x2F;18&#x2F;the-world-is-squared-episode-4-in-hot-places&#x2F;)

[&quot;Having grown up next to the seaside in North Wales, the South Pacific was something of a culture shock.&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;12&#x2F;the-world-is-squared-part-5-balinese-interlude&#x2F;)

[&quot;One of the things that originally got me interested in the subject of economics was asking the question &#39;How come they’re able to send lamb and butter all the way from New Zealand and still sell it cheaper than Wales?&#39;, and never being very satisfied with the answer.&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;03&#x2F;22&#x2F;the-world-is-squared-episode-6-midsummer-in-midwinter&#x2F;)

[&quot;If you’re reading about Easter Island at all, you quickly find yourself realising that you’ve got to make your mind up about the &#39;Jared Diamond Question&#39;. That question being, whether the view of Easter Island’s development and history in his book _Decline_ bears any resemblance to reality at all.&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;24&#x2F;the-world-is-squared-episode-7-across-the-pacific-islands&#x2F;)

(Relatedly, [&quot;The lazy man’s way to business success&quot; (2007)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2007&#x2F;09&#x2F;11&#x2F;the-lazy-mans-way-to-business-success&#x2F;):

&gt; If you are a young man or woman of fair-to-middling ability, or even a borderline dullard, but you want to get a reputation as an uncommonly bright and perspicacious thinker, it’s really not that hard to do. The secret weapon is this: _take an interest in what happens in other countries_.  
&gt; ...Even in situations which look purely domestic, you can often get an entirely new perspective on things by looking at your fundamental assumptions in the light of what happens overseas. There are few sights sweeter than the look on someone’s face after they’ve confidently proclaimed something to be impossible, only to be informed that they’ve been doing things that way in Australia for the last twenty years....  
&gt; It’s also a great way to generate ideas; it’s both easier than coming up with something yourself, and more likely to succeed, to plagiarise something that’s already worked well in a different time zone....  
&gt; So my advice to a young businessperson is to save ten minutes a day by not reading the domestic news, and spend them on reading the international news properly.

**Reflections on writing on the Internet**

[&quot;Abuse: A coping strategy&quot; (2006, in _The Guardian_), guidelines on how to deal with negative feedback from commenters](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;2006&#x2F;may&#x2F;18&#x2F;nerdkungfu), informed by his years being yelled at within the finance industry: &quot;**operate a graduated response**. In general it makes sense to be a bit _more polite_ than your critic up to a certain threshold, and a bit _ruder_ thereafter.&quot;

In Crooked Timber comments in 2013, [Davies writes a reply to a critic that includes the line &quot;Have a bloody word with yourself, will you? Your ideas about the relative obligations of the world to provide you with exactly what you want, versus your own obligation to be polite or pleasant to other people, are very badly calibrated.&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2013&#x2F;03&#x2F;19&#x2F;what-would-you-do-part-2-the-island-of-surpyc&#x2F;#comment-459055)

[&quot;The Verjus Manifesto&quot; (2015, on Medium)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@dsquareddigest&#x2F;the-verjus-manifesto-3e396cd00421):

&gt; When it comes to readership, quality matters at least as much as quantity....
&gt; 
&gt; It’s much better to write the piece that you want to read yourself, which usually means pitching the technical content at a level slightly _higher_ than you were comfortable with when you started thinking about it. That doesn’t mean using jargon or writing dull sentences, but it does mean refusing to dumb down, and it definitely means keeping all the complexity in the article which you were able to wrap your own head around.
&gt; 
&gt; You get fewer readers this way, but more of them email you. And if you do it right, some of the ones that email you are real professionals — people who you never imagined having a conversation with when you started writing stuff on a website. Rather than sifting through a thousand comments section bores, you attract an audience that is more likely to be sufficiently interested in the subject to make an effort to carry on a conversation, and exponentially more likely to have an interesting point when they do so.
