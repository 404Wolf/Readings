### or, RC week #1

I started RC this week! It is absolutely everything I expected and more!!! If there is anything at all you love about programming and you are able to find the time to do something that does not pay you money for a while I would wholly recommend it. 

**An abbreviated list of the things I went to&#x2F;did this week**

* Cold messaged people, even though it was scary
* Attended HCI, web dev, game dev, audio programming, Rust, and creative coding groups
* Joined an OCaml learning group and got halfway through some introductory OCaml materials
* Gauged interest for, and started preparing for an Arduino talk
* Chatted with a ton of people about their work and their stories one-on-one
* Wrote a generative text program that only knows the Bible and Urban Dictionary
* Saw people’s presentations on their technical projects, which were the highlight of my week. Still thinking about the guy who input a password to a Raspberry Pi through a landline using a synthesized series of dial tones

I expressed to one of the retreat organizers that it felt like I was a child at a buffet dazzled by everything laid out before me, picking and choosing bits of each dish, and then getting to the end and being like, Oh No, I’ve messed up (hardly actually programmed at all). Or it’s like when you go to Chipotle and you ask them to put everything in your burrito, and then you realize the burrito is not a burrito but a soggy, structurally pathetic mess of tortilla and salsa and sour cream dripping down your hands, and you resign yourself to the fact that you lost your dignity somewhere between the first and second bites—but it’s also still delicious!!! Essentially I don’t regret how I spent the first week, but I have also resolved to make sure the coming weeks are different by carving out space for solo, locked-in coding time. 

I think part of me is scared to program alone. I am still reeling from the effects of going to a rigorous computer science focused school, where the coding statement was not an enticing problem space to explore, but a dead end, a promise of sitting at my computer at one in the morning with a nasty bug, dreading the deadline, too terrified to even look at the writeup anymore. When I hit bugs programming by myself, I tend to start catastrophizing, confident that I will never be able to come up with a solution and will need to go run and cry to a TA who will condescendingly show me a fix. 

Somehow the mere presence of someone else can force me out of this self-deprecating feedback loop—someone being next to me tends to soothe my brain, assuring it that there is a safety net if things get tough, even if it’s just a smile and some affirmations when I can’t immediately parse the error messages. Even if I’m the one coming up with all the bug fixes, and articulating my thought process with clarity, it feels like my groundedness still derives from the presence of another; I still somehow can’t imagine transposing that confidence onto solo coding. I am trying my best to address this during RC—allowing myself to pair with others to assuage these fears, but also occasionally venturing out into the scary land of sitting alone at my computer and staring down error logs, and then coming out the other side victorious. It is possible! I know it is! I am working towards it.

I am also trying to break out of another nasty mindset that I developed at CMU: the idea that I can’t do something if someone’s “already done it”. If I know someone who’s already good at \[insert: game development, web development, HCI, machine learning, etc.\] then I might as well not even try, because I’m too late to the party. It’s a scarcity mindset, the idea that there are “web dev people”, and there can only be so many, and I am of course not one of them. I had a lovely chat with a past Recurser, E, where I expressed this to her, and she suggested that I should frame it more like: if I learn, say, React, the way I write it will be entirely unlike anyone else. There aren’t limited slots for people who want to do web development, or creative coding, or functional programming—in fact, the more people who do these things, the greater variety of ideas, projects, and discoveries we’ll have in the world. Everyone can do \[x widespread thing\] in their own inimitable way, and in fact it’s probably not even possible for two people to write precisely the same code—as humans we’re incredibly divergent on this scale. It was an invigorating conversation, and it’s something I’ll be keeping in mind for a long time, this self-given permission to break into new domains and explore them in my own unique way.

**My goals for RC**

1. Build a website where people can leave anonymous notes about their long distance friendships&#x2F;relationships&#x2F;family. Make sure I can approve people&#39;s notes, make it fast to display the all the notes in a specific geographical area a user is looking at, embed a map API, make the interface robust. Get a great intermediate-level understanding of the whole web stack, from frontend to business logic to hosting to databases.
2. Bring up my home assistant, Hestia, to a basic working state. In order of decreasing priority, build a vocal interface —&gt; be able to search the web, vocally —&gt; build a locally accessible web dashboard —&gt; integrate with Zulip —&gt; be able to control some kind of IoT device —&gt; integrate with Discord —&gt; integrate with Spotify —&gt; integrate with SMS’s —&gt; integrate with weather.
3. Gain a stronger understanding of functional programming paradigms through learning OCaml and Rust; ultimately programming feature-restricted versions of Baba Is You in both languages.
4. Research and deliver at least one talk on play and agency in hardware hacking!
5. Advance somehow in my job search… &#x3D;\_\_&#x3D;;;

I keep experiencing this funny sort of shock at RC, where I keep accidentally thinking people are close to my age (early 20’s) and then they end up being, like, thirty and a professor at a university. I’m obviously biased from being in a university environment for so long, where everyone is about your age, but it’s also challenging because I’m only meeting people over Zoom, and also people in their 20’s and sometimes early 30’s tend to look much more similar to one another than, say, 14 year olds do to 18 year olds. All that said, I am one of the youngest Recursers in my batch.

In some ways, it kind of sucks being young. I dislike that so many of my life problems are solved by things like waiting, or trying a lot of different things to see what works for me in particular. I dislike that I spend all day at my computer, eager to check Zulip or poke at some learning resources, wholly ignoring the seizing pains in my back and neck. I dislike that forming lasting, healthy habits is a slow, dedicated, meditative process. I want things now; I read the first ten pages of dozens of books on Google Books previews. I want things to come easily; I start a hundred projects and abandon them after weeks. I imagine myself already having done the huge, meaningful, intelligent things that live half-formed in my mind, and it feels so good I forget to sit down and do the work of bringing them to life. 

But I also like being young. I like being the youngest, least experienced, least learned person in a room. I like seeing the great heights of other people’s achievements laid out before me, and I like the way this provides not a constricted set of directions, but a general map for what I might achieve myself. I like being young at RC, because it feels like it gives me permission to stop comparing myself to others, to be exactly who I am and where I am on my journey, because everyone has such disparate paths and has accomplished such a wide variety of things.

In personal news,

**Yoga**

Various scattered thoughts:

I once was scrolling through stretching websites and I came across a common sentiment that a lot of flexibility is in your mind. Meaning, your body is physically capable of going much further, but your brain is afraid that you’ll hurt yourself (because you’ve spent so much time sitting, lying down, etc.), so it prevents you from going all the way to protect you. I’ve been tossing and turning it over in my mind whenever I stretch. Whenever I sit down and reach for my toes—feeling that familiar stretch-ache in my lower back, my hamstrings, even my thighs and feet and upper back—I also try to identify that glimmering thread of fear that runs through the unpleasant sensation. It lives in my head and my gut, that urge to _stop doing this_ and that inkling that I’ll break something, that it’s not _right_, that my body was made for the shape of sitting in an office chair and any trespass into lands of foreign contortions will surely yield something very bad (what? I don’t know). So I try to breathe in and then breathe the fear out, inching my knees closer to the ground as I do, and sitting in the new sensation, still in one piece, braver and more flexible than I was ten seconds ago. 

The part about your brain wanting to protect you also sticks in my mind a lot; actually I’ve been trying to understand a lot of what my body does in protective, nurturing lenses, rather than getting so mad that everything hurts so much all the time. Your body doesn’t just start hurting out of spite, it starts hurting because you’ve moved out of a comfortable equilibrium and it needs to signal you to take care, to move slow or stretch out or drink water or eat something. 

Even the origins of my pain come from my body wanting to take care—first, it relaxes the lower back, thinking this will relieve tension, then the upper, and then when it has nowhere else to go, shuttles all the strain into my neck and shoulders. Despite my constant exasperation with my shoulder pain, I understand that it has earnest origins; it’s the end result of my body instinctively trying to loosen me up and failing. Recently I’ve stumbled upon a realization that is extremely obvious in retrospect, which is that introducing more tension in one place to relieve tension in another place is hardly productive. I would do this subconsciously, all the time, when I did yoga in the past. Striving to lengthen my neck muscles, I’d unduly tighten my lower back, ostensibly to provide a foundation for the awkward positions I put myself in. Ultimately I was temporarily relieving one area of my body at the cost of another, which is ironically what got me into this whole mess in the first place. I’ve found that it is entirely possible to push my stretching of one area right up to the uncomfortable edge, while also keeping a mindful eye on the rest of my body, making sure it’s not tightening, but relaxing into the strange new position. 

**Books**

I’ve been rather negligent about reading lately so I’ve only just started these:

* _Self-Help_ by Lorrie Moore  
   * Contrary to what the title might suggest, _Self-Help_ is a collection of short stories about affairs, divorce, love, illness, and so on. Moore is an excellent and rather clever writer; one of my favorite things about the collection is how she tends to obfuscate transitions? This is hard to explain if you haven’t read the book, but she likes to end one paragraph, and then maybe start up a dialogue in a way that suggests it’s being spoken by the characters in the section we’ve just come from, but quickly from the contents of the dialogue you realize that we’ve changed characters and setting. It’s wonderfully disarming, and part of why I will always love pure literature as a vehicle for storytelling, despite my fondness for more extravagant mechanisms like films, games, comics, etc.
* _The Book of Delights_ by Ross Gay  
   * Aligned with what the title might suggest, _The Book of Delights_ is an incredibly delightful book. Gay has such a way with cradling delight in full recognition of the pain and anger in the world that seek to diminish it—relaying fond memories with an old friend who passed away; juxtaposing the horrors of medical racism in the US against the joy of being subtly acknowledged by other Black people wherever he goes. There is a brightness and an ease to which he writes that I’d love to channel in my own work.
* _Color and Light_ by James Gurney  
   * My girlfriend got me a bunch of art textbooks for my birthday!!!!! The first one I’ve started digging into is this book on color and light for painters by James Gurney, and I’m excited to try out some of the ideas he presents in the book. Probably most notable so far has been the section on rethinking the color wheel, which definitely had me going, “Wow, I thought I understood color theory but I actually didn’t at all.”

**Shows&#x2F;Films**

* _Interview with the Vampire_  
   * So incredibly good, I want everyone to watch it and I also never want it to get big, ever. You can really tell it’s a passion project for everyone involved, given that it’s a little weird, a little niche, and not very widely marketable. Everyone is hot, even and especially when they’re doing their little vampire murder rituals! I can’t believe we live in a day and age where we get representation for gay couples where both of the members are POC! I have so many feelings about Assad Zaman as Armand.
* _Princess Mononoke_  
   * Still absolutely stunning, just as it was when I watched it at thirteen. In true Ghibli fashion, it simultaneously explores the push and pull between man and nature; harbors a deep anti-war sentiment; paints rich, emotional pictures of each character and their relationships; and does it all with a loving and meticulous eye towards every single frame. It’s a breathtaking movie, and the small amount of digging I did into what graphics technologies were developed to support the movie left me deeply curious about 3D graphics, again ;\_\_; There is not enough time in the world for all the things I want to learn!
* _Synecdoche, New York_  
   * Sometimes a movie makes you feel so bad you keel over for five minutes at the end and then immediately get up to recommend it to your friends.

**Art**

I’ve begun painting again. I am not entirely at a place I am happy with, but I am making things, and that is infinitely better than not making things. I’m using the Turner Acrylic Gouache I bought back at the start of the year and never used. For those unfamiliar, standard Gouache is a paint that is basically like watercolor but with a heightened capacity for opacity (ha). So you can get really bold, pigment-packed colors, as well as lay down super soft forms in the way of watercolors. Acrylic Gouache is very similar but it is much harder to reactivate with water, similar to Acrylic paint. So once it dries, it dries, which makes it a slightly challenging paint to wrangle.

Here is something I painted that I like:

I have got to get better at taking and editing these so the colors are faithful to reality

I’ve realized that I love color. I keep thinking back to when I was in high school and reading Maggie Nelson’s _Bluets_ and thinking it good but rather dramatic, and now I’m like, no, these are entirely understandable responses when you are in love with a color. 

Next, I want to try painting a friend’s nature photographs (if you know who this friend is, shh, don’t tell them, it’s a surprise). I want to try a bunch of different colorways on the same photo and see how they come out.
