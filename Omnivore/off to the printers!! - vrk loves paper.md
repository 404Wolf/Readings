Hello everyone!!

WOW, March was so busy!! There were new and exciting opportunities that came up, wonderful conversations that were had, fun parties and events and friends in town‚Ä¶ At the same time, this was a month where I really needed to stick to my priorities, which were basically:

1. FINISH POUCH
2. (everything else)

It‚Äôs April now, and I‚Äôm relieved to say: Pouch Issue 1 is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶??

I don‚Äôt want to say ‚Äúdone!!!‚Äù 

In software engineering, there‚Äôs a stage of a project that‚Äôs called ‚Äúcode complete,‚Äù when you‚Äôve written all the code that you need for the feature, and in your own brief testing, the feature seems to work. You say you‚Äôre ‚Äúcode complete‚Äù though, and not ‚Äúdone,‚Äù because it‚Äôs not ready to be shipped out to users yet. You usually have to do way more testing, fix bugs and other problems, etc before you‚Äôre ready for launch.

There has to be an equivalent term for this for magazines, right? I don‚Äôt know what it is though, so for now we‚Äôre gonna say: Pouch Issue 1 is code complete!! üòÇ Every page is finished, designed, and laid out in InDesign, and I formatted the PDF and sent off a test print order to Mixam. I should be ready to fulfill preorders soon!

Final page count: 50!!! üò± The Pouch Preview issue was 22 pages long, so in March I basically created another Pouch &amp; a half. Honestly it might be _too_ long now, but we‚Äôll see how it feels when I get the test prints!

There‚Äôs a lot to talk about in today‚Äôs newsletter, such as: A deep dive on redesigning the Pouch cover, what‚Äôs new in Pouch Issue 1, also I had a big üí° about marketing Pouch and I sorta renamed Pouch Cafe to Pouch Studio, also I got into Stationery Fest!!!, aaaand more!

I hope you enjoy!! üå∏

As part of my sprint to finish Pouch issue 1, I gave Pouch a totally new cover!!

I really loved my original cover, but as I used it over the last few months, I realized there were some major design issues with it:

### 1\. It doesn‚Äôt communicate what it is

On one hand, a cover of a book doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to tell you what a book is going to be about. On the other hand, Pouch is a magazine with a target audience: Journalers and Stationery lovers. I actually got some feedback from my early preview readers about this, that the content of Pouch is quite specific, and even calling it for ‚Äúpaper lovers‚Äù is too broad. Being clearer on this from the very start seemed like a good idea!

The original cover is a little mysterious, like ‚Äúoh, what could this be?‚Äù But since I‚Äôm targeting a specific niche, I think the cover should be super obvious in explaining what it‚Äôs about, like, ‚ÄúHEY HELLO HI, STATIONERY FANS?! I AM FOR YOU!!!‚Äù

### 2\. Pouch isn‚Äôt minimal

[![](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app&#x2F;1456x644,suVRHRLni03t39q9-tVYExaWQ5Iv9LRc25Wj3EIzsMlw&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;substackcdn.com&#x2F;image&#x2F;fetch&#x2F;w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep&#x2F;https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28fd1138-70f9-44f2-bff9-994f9567018a_2874x1272.png)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;substackcdn.com&#x2F;image&#x2F;fetch&#x2F;f%5Fauto,q%5Fauto:good,fl%5Fprogressive:steep&#x2F;https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28fd1138-70f9-44f2-bff9-994f9567018a%5F2874x1272.png)

My original cover was also a relatively minimal and clean design. But the inside of Pouch is fun and playful! I wanted my cover to reflect that!

### 3\. The lettering was sloppy (and not a vector)

[![](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app&#x2F;1456x455,suHYnK8NRBh1ApAcxLRXlEk5ZD9jVywaqYAsQbNNKEk8&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;substackcdn.com&#x2F;image&#x2F;fetch&#x2F;w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep&#x2F;https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17a81655-ffb7-43d6-972b-8dba52483917_2447x764.png)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;substackcdn.com&#x2F;image&#x2F;fetch&#x2F;f%5Fauto,q%5Fauto:good,fl%5Fprogressive:steep&#x2F;https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17a81655-ffb7-43d6-972b-8dba52483917%5F2447x764.png)

The more time I spent with these letters, the more I could see the sloppiness in their construction üò≠ I really wanted to do another take at these letters with more thought and intention, and in a vector format so it was easier to reuse.

## ü§∫ The design battle that ensued!!

Whew friends, this was NOT easy to redesign!!!

My biggest hang up was, ironically, restrictions I put in place to limit the scope of the redesign so it wasn‚Äôt too much work.

I told myself I should just incrementally improve the cover as best as I could in 1-2 days, and as part of that, I was convinced I should keep the same illustration. I can draw \~ OK \~, but I am not even close to having the skill set of a professional illustrator, so it just seemed so risky to try another cover illustration.

I tried to work with what I had and‚Ä¶.

[![](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app&#x2F;1456x469,sBIP756UgLiMThV6k6staZhXcNxVgSudCRGiikbId6x0&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;substackcdn.com&#x2F;image&#x2F;fetch&#x2F;w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep&#x2F;https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b3f0872-8a23-4a36-9d2b-ea14f91f4693_2874x926.png)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;substackcdn.com&#x2F;image&#x2F;fetch&#x2F;f%5Fauto,q%5Fauto:good,fl%5Fprogressive:steep&#x2F;https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b3f0872-8a23-4a36-9d2b-ea14f91f4693%5F2874x926.png)

Sighhhh. I didn‚Äôt like anything I was coming up with.

I needed to consider redoing the cover entirely!

To try out ideas quickly and cheaply, I started using photos and illustrations from Pinterest to visually prototype what a new design could look like. This still took hours!! I was tried all sorts of concepts: Patterns, product photography, manga, classic American magazines, retro Korean fashion magazines‚Ä¶

Finally I mashed up my Pouch title with this [sweet illustration](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;youou%5F271&#x2F;status&#x2F;1373228867670876161) of Miffy kimonos lol:

oooooooohhhhh 

**THIS** was getting somewhere!! _(Btw: do you notice how the colors on the right are a bit more muted from the ones on the left? THIS ADDED ANOTHER DIMENSION OF PAIN_ üò≠ _Print colors (CMYK) are sooo much more limited than screen colors (RGB) sighhh. anyway!!)_

I took a moment to analyze what made this ‚Äúcover‚Äù work:

* A bold, trendy, limited color palette
* Having _people_ on the cover definitely makes me connect to it more
* The illustration is clear and the subtitle is even clearer, ‚ÄúMiffy x Kimono‚Äù

I decided I needed a new illustration! Something with a person in it, and something that is more at the heart of what Pouch is about. Pouch isn‚Äôt a zine about pouches; it‚Äôs about stationery and journaling. Let‚Äôs have an illustration of a person who is journaling with her stationery!

I also decided to take a much more cautious approach to the illustration. With the original illustration, I drew it in pencil, scanned it, outlined it, colored it, and _then_ put it in the design. Only then did I realize that the illustration was kind of awkward for the cover, but it was too late!

This time, I decided to do the illustration and the design of the cover in tandem:

[![](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app&#x2F;1456x1210,s22oysqQAcpbCZLJ3l3bF99_id902mMdQqaXtKISNW-g&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;substackcdn.com&#x2F;image&#x2F;fetch&#x2F;w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep&#x2F;https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5702c034-1f1c-4964-9a65-62602cc203f4_5456x4536.png)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;substackcdn.com&#x2F;image&#x2F;fetch&#x2F;f%5Fauto,q%5Fauto:good,fl%5Fprogressive:steep&#x2F;https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5702c034-1f1c-4964-9a65-62602cc203f4%5F5456x4536.png)

And that‚Äôs how I came to the final cover!! I‚Äôm much happier with this cover than the previous version!

(‚Ä¶Though I‚Äôm self-conscious about the colors I chose. üò≠ Colors are so hard!!!!)

## üî§ Oh yeah, the letters!!

I forgot to mention how I redid the Pouch letters! I made a go at it in Procreate first, and my very first attempted looked HORRIBLE lol. 

I then watched the first 90 seconds of this video on [how to do write letters in Procreate](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;lfL4l27Nm5I), and honestly my mind was blown üòÜ He drew guidelines? He sketched out each letter first using a pencil brush?? 

Alright let‚Äôs give this a shot!!

Here‚Äôs a timelapse of my video from Procreate, including my horrible first try, and then the attempt with guidelines:

After this sketch, I manually converted it to a vector in Illustrator using bezier tool, then I was done. Wasn‚Äôt too bad!

## üê∑ Pouch is now 50 pages long

My battle with the Pouch cover, while dramatic, happened just over the course of 2 days!! The rest of March, I was finishing the other 30 pages I added to Pouch, in addition to incorporating feedback and doing the rest of what was needed to finish the magazine.

Here‚Äôs what I added:

1. An interview with dear friend &amp; journaler extraordinaire, [@nikki.kaigi](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;nikki.kaigi&#x2F;)
2. A 16-page journal layout gallery, featuring journals from 8 creators
3. A directory of recommended stationery stores

### Why spend so long on Issue 1?

Plenty of folks have asked me why I am spending so much time on just issue 1 of Pouch. This is an excellent question! I could have shipped a rougher, shorter Pouch Issue 1 and continued to make improvements in Issue 2 and beyond.

However, I am NOT planning to publish Issue 2 right away ‚Äî I actually haven‚Äôt committed to any regular publishing schedule for Pouch yet. Instead, I‚Äôm treating Pouch Issue 1 as a pilot of the magazine. I want to gauge interest for a magazine like this, get feedback, see what sales are like, and then make a plan for Issue 2 and beyond.

Therefore, I really want to make sure Pouch Issue 1 communicates the vision of what I‚Äôm trying to do, so that I have as meaningful of a test as possible. I could have made Pouch much less polished, but a crucial part of my vision for Pouch is the colorful, playful design. As for the additional content, my original 22-page preview issue didn‚Äôt have _any_ community contributions, and for my vision of the magazine, the community is absolutely essential!

The other big reason I‚Äôm taking so long on Pouch Issue 1 is because this is also a project to help me strengthen my print design skills! Having an ambitious quality bar makes me have to stretch much farther and learn more.

Anyway, this plan was not without trade-offs!! 50 pages is still longer than I intended üòÜ and I‚Äôm worried this is too many pages for the form factor. I‚Äôll see how it feels when I get the test prints, though!

Regardless: Pouch Issue 1 feels finished\* now (\*code complete üòÜ) and I‚Äôm excited to soon start testing this pilot properly!

## üé¨ @pouch.cafe ‚Üí @pouch.studio

In the last newsletter, I was struggling with marketing Pouch. After a really helpful chat with my friend Kelin, I realized a big part of my struggle was that having an Instagram for ‚ÄúPouch Cafe, Zine Store‚Äù wasn‚Äôt serving me:

[![](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app&#x2F;420x0,sLetkQjzGLKomcXBfJGZmMZSNJofiAjDq7pM5wpqydXk&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;substackcdn.com&#x2F;image&#x2F;fetch&#x2F;w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep&#x2F;https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F983c0be6-5ced-40ee-aece-1eaac3b13240_4464x5402.png)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;substackcdn.com&#x2F;image&#x2F;fetch&#x2F;f%5Fauto,q%5Fauto:good,fl%5Fprogressive:steep&#x2F;https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F983c0be6-5ced-40ee-aece-1eaac3b13240%5F4464x5402.png)

To put it simply:

* It‚Äôs useful for me to have a home for Pouch magazine, specifically.
* It‚Äôs useful for me to have a home for _everything_ I‚Äôm doing creatively.

‚Ä¶But having _just_ a zine store is a weird in-between. It‚Äôs neither specific enough to be clear and easy to explain, nor broad enough to encompass my other creative projects.

Therefore I‚Äôm in the process of reconfiguring my communication strategy!! I haven‚Äôt finished this transition because, well, Pouch Issue 1 was the #1 thing I needed to finish in March and took up the vast majority of my time. So right at this very moment, my web presence for Pouch is kind of a mess! I‚Äôll get this all sorted out in April üòÇ

As a first step, though, I renamed my Instagram from @pouch.cafe to @[pouch.studio](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;pouch.studio&#x2F;) üíñ It‚Äôll be the home of all my creative projects, not just Pouch or my zines!! I have a [commemorative Reel that explains](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;C4YisP-J4GW&#x2F;), if you wanna watch üòÜ

I also took a stab at making &lt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pouch.studio&#x2F;&gt; but uhhh kind of a mess!!

## üéè Pouch at Stationery Fest!!

Friends!!! I will officially be at [Stationery Fest](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stationeryfestival.com&#x2F;) with Pouch in August!!! ü•π 

Pouch isn‚Äôt on the Stationery Fest website yet, but honestly what a blessing, because like I said in the previous section, my websites are in transition LOL. I‚Äôm gonna ask about it when I _have_ a website I want them to link‚Ä¶

But I‚Äôm very very excited for this!! In addition to tabling, I‚Äôm also going to be running a few workshops about printers üòÇ truly my dream!!

More on Stationery Fest in newsletters to come!! üéä

## üê∞ and moree??

Substack keeps telling me ‚ÄúPost too long for email‚Äù so I really gotta wrap this up!! I‚Äôll just add a few more bits of news:

* I‚Äôll be at [Milwaukee Zine Fest](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.binderymke.com&#x2F;milwaukeezinefest) in a few weeks!! Come say hi if you‚Äôre in the area! :D
* I‚Äôm considering moving my zine store from [Gumroad](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gumroad.com&#x2F;) to [Fourthwall](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fourthwall.com&#x2F;). Gumroad has a generous offering, but I find Gumroad store UIs to be a bit confusing and also heavily Gumroad-branded. Gumroad‚Äôs discovery is also virtually nonexistent. Whereas stores on Fourthwall are a lot more modern-looking, are way more customizable, they don‚Äôt take a cut for physical orders (!!), and they support custom domains, all for free! Downsides: No discovery on Fourthwall, either, and there are some rough edges, like I keep finding typos üò≠ Doesn‚Äôt exactly inspire confidence! Still, payments are handled through Stripe (i.e. I have high confidence there), and the customization is really quite good‚Ä¶ I might try it! LMK if anyone has experience with Fourthwall, good or bad!

Have a wonderful April, everyone!! Enjoy some flowers in your area üå∏
