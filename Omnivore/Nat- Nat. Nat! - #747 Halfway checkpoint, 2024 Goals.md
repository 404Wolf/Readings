At the beginning of the year, I wrote [Goals for 2024](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writing.natwelch.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;731). It&#39;s amazing to me it has been over six months since I wrote that. It makes me realize how much time passes and how easily it is to forget things, or drop habits when something comes up.

My goals were as follows:

* Keep a public culture consumption diary
* Blog once a month
* Finish locative garden
* Make music once a week
* Go fishing once a month
* 30 minutes of exercise three times a week
* Remove all credit card debt
* Find a monthly in person social thing

It all seemed so reasonable! Some progress has been made, but also some stuff has definitely slipped.

Lets group these into to category and take a look at them:

## Writing: Keep a public culture consumption diary, Blog once a month, Finish locative garden.

My friend Sumana has been a huge help here, she and I have been meeting roughly once a week to write over video-conference. I&#39;ve made a lot of progress on locative, blogged a little and I had a stint where I was regularly posting [#happy](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writing.natwelch.com&#x2F;tag&#x2F;happy) posts.

So by the numbers: In six months, I did two of six full blog posts. I also posted [#happy](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writing.natwelch.com&#x2F;tag&#x2F;happy) posts 11 out of 26 weeks.

For the fishing and exercise portions, I had fits and spurts. I messed up my ankle at one point due to not stretching well, which made walking very difficult for about two months. But I did go fishing a few times, and I had weeks where I regularly did exercise. Also a lot of weeks where I didn&#39;t. Lately Mel and I have been walking after dinner, which has been a good forcing function.

Music making has been much more of a success story. I&#39;m pretty regularly making music once a week. Even if it&#39;s just a quick break before a meeting, having a little music station right next to my work desk has been great. I&#39;m occasionally posting some of my practice on YouTube. For example, the other night I posted [this little riff](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;rVa75atfe3E?si&#x3D;BAZsHIJS8tU2ZJPd) I discovered before bed.

I just recently found a monthly social thing though! Shout out to all of the friends and acquaintances who sent suggestions: [Trout Unlimited Mid-Hudson](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.midhudsontroutunlimited.org&#x2F;), [Sound](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;luckdragon.space&#x2F;event&#x2F;sound.html), [Lit Lit](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;donnaminkowitz.com&#x2F;lit-lit&#x2F;) and [Club Draw](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soyrosendale.com&#x2F;event&#x2F;club-draw-session-25&#x2F;).

While they are all super interesting, and I went to some of those events, the real winner for me was finding the [Gunks Gaming Guild](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gunksgamingguild.com&#x2F;) in New Paltz. Their website kind of sucks, but I happened to join their discord, and a whole world was opened up. A ton of people looking for D&amp;D players, board game aficionados, etc. So I&#39;ve now played a few D&amp;D sessions there, and it&#39;s been a great social outlet. I&#39;m going to keep looking and trying some of the other events I mentioned, but I feel like I&#39;m making progress.

## Finances: Remove all credit card debt

We made some progress on this, but not much. Here&#39;s to the back half of the year.

## Other stuff

Work continues to be very stressful. Depending on the day it&#39;s either fantastic or infuriating. Our Quarterly get together is next week though, so I&#39;m hopeful it relives some of the stress.

Mel moves to London in September for a year to attend the London School of Economics for a masters in Criminal Justice Policy. So getting my mental health habits in place and sticking to them will be super important.

That&#39;s about it! I hope you are doing well wherever you are. Lots of love from the east coast.
