* Fairly ambiguous most of the time. Is it? Is it not? Could it be?
* Fringe and on the fence, walking a fine line, borderline
* Unmentionable, invisible, and nondescript
* When theater even seems confined and not enough
* When everything is a draft
* Dusting your broom art
* Throwing yourself at things while taking no offense art
* Little mouse art
* Humanizing something free of error art
* When everything connects
* Mirror mirror, fact and fiction art
* Public, outsider, informal
* Fleeting, hard to put a finger on
* No joke, no picnic, nonstop, everyday, high risk, adventurous
* Art worth living in
* The biggest test and greatest mystery
* No more
