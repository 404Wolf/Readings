_status: ✅ done!_

Didn’t intend to make this when I was thinking of recurse projects, but three days in drowning in and struggling express so many ideas, it seemed crucial! I originally intended to build it from scratch with Next.js, but after some very good advice from my brother [Noah](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;noahlk.medium.com&#x2F;)realized there were many, many easier ways. You’re reading on it now, so project #1, done!

An input device that is worn as a glove and allows the user to output a different signal for every pad of their finger by pressing their thumb against it. This signal can be augmented with the angle of the hand, detected by an accelerometer&#x2F;gyroscope sensor, and feedback to the user (like that a signal was created as desired) can be provided using small haptic feedback motors.
