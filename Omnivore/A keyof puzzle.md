_Effective TypeScript_ is nearly 400 pages long, but I&#39;ve received the most feedback by far on just one passage. It comes in [Item 7: Think of Types as Sets of Values](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;danvk&#x2F;effective-typescript&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;samples&#x2F;ch-types&#x2F;types-as-sets.md):

&gt; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;gcode
&gt; keyof (A&amp;B) &#x3D; (keyof A) | (keyof B)
&gt; keyof (A|B) &#x3D; (keyof A) &amp; (keyof B)
&gt; 
&gt; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
&gt; 
&gt; If you can build an intuition for why these equations hold, you&#39;ll have come a long way toward understanding TypeScript&#39;s type system!

I&#39;ll explain these equations in a moment. But before I do, head over to the [TypeScript Playground](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.typescriptlang.org&#x2F;play&#x2F;?#code&#x2F;JYOwLgpgTgZghgYwgAgHJwLYQCYAUD2oYyA3gFDLIiYQBcyAzmFKAOYDcFyAHvSAK4YARtE6UAnn0EionAL5ki0eEmQEiAZgAipLryrTRXSQeFHKALylnZZBWQT4QTKjWwANAJoAtZAF5dSmosegByVAgAd2RPfCgAa1CAGj16AFoAdg0UiXoAFgAGHOQrZCK7TkdnYhBxBFR6dCw8QnB-V2avb3ZkAHpe5Hx4gEIHJxdahG96dXBtduCcLp7+wZGyMjBxAAcUAGlUdpI5ZAAyZHiIcXwYNDdZsE5VygA9AH5Nnf2NI5Pzy+utwe2ieA1eH0+u2QewAku0ATdkAAKJo4B5nNStMDaACUoMoyHekP2AFV2kiEbdUS0iDjkAAfZGUzGaLQ4sjPQkfIA) and test them out with a few types. See if you can build that intuition for why they hold.

I first saw these equations in Anders Hejlsberg&#39;s [keynote at TSConf 2018](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;wpgKd-rwnMw?si&#x3D;szTbEWSFGCF8xp2x&amp;t&#x3D;1576) (&quot;Higher order type equivalences&quot; at 26m15s):

Anders&#39; explanation at the talk was helpful, but I still had to stare at them for a long time before they clicked. But when they did, I felt like I&#39;d had a real insight about how TypeScript types work.

The feedback on these equations in the book is typically that I need to explain them more. Some readers have even claimed they&#39;re wrong. (They&#39;re not!) By presenting them a bit cryptically, I wanted to give readers a chance to think through them and have an insight of their own.

With that out of the way, let&#39;s dig into why these equations hold, and why they&#39;re interesting.

We can start by plugging in concrete types for &#x60;A&#x60; and &#x60;B&#x60;:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;css
interface NamedPoint {
  name: string;
  x: number;
  y: number;
}
interface Point3D {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  z: number;
}

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

What&#39;s &#x60;NamedPoint &amp; Point3D&#x60;, the intersection of these two types? It&#39;s easy to think that it&#39;s an &#x60;interface&#x60; with just the common fields:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;typescript
&#x2F;&#x2F; This is _not_ the same as NamedPoint &amp; Point3D!
interface CommonFields {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

That&#39;s not what it is, though. To understand the intersection of these types, we need to think a little more about what values are assignable to each type. A &#x60;NamedPoint&#x60; is an object with three properties, &#x60;name&#x60;, &#x60;x&#x60;, and &#x60;y&#x60;, with the expected types:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;yaml
const nyc: NamedPoint &#x3D; {
  name: &#39;New York&#39;,
  x: -73,
  y: 40,
};

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

But a &#x60;NamedPoint&#x60; could have other properties, too. In particular it could have a &#x60;z&#x60; property:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;yaml
const namedXYZ &#x3D; {
  name: &#39;New York&#39;,
  x: -73,
  y: 40,
  z: 0,
};
const nycN: NamedPoint &#x3D; namedXYZ; &#x2F;&#x2F; ok!

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

(We have to go through an intermediate object to avoid [excess property checking](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observablehq.com&#x2F;@koop&#x2F;excess-property-checking-in-typescript) errors here. If you have a copy of [_Effective TypeScript_](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amzn.to&#x2F;3UjPrsK), check out [Item 11: Distinguish Excess Property Checking from Type Checking](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;danvk&#x2F;effective-typescript&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;samples&#x2F;ch-types&#x2F;excess-property-checking.md).)

There&#39;s nothing special about &#x60;z&#x60;. It could have other properties, too, and still be assignable to &#x60;NamedPoint&#x60;. For this reason, we sometimes say that TypeScript types are &quot;open.&quot;

Of course, &#x60;Point3D&#x60; is open, too. It could also have other fields, including a &#x60;name&#x60; field:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;actionscript
const nycZ: Point3D &#x3D; namedXYZ; &#x2F;&#x2F; ok!

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

So &#x60;namedXYZ&#x60; is assignable to both &#x60;NamedPoint&#x60; and &#x60;Point3D&#x60;. And that is the very definition of an intersection. Sure enough, &#x60;namedXYZ&#x60; is assignable to the intersection of these types, too:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;1c
const nycZ: Point3D &amp; NamedPoint &#x3D; namedXYZ; &#x2F;&#x2F; ok!

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

This gives us a hint about what the intersection looks like:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;css
interface NamedPoint3D {
  name: string;
  x: number;
  y: number;
  z: number;
}

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

This type is _also_ &quot;open:&quot; a &#x60;NamedPoint3D&#x60; might have more than these four fields. But it has to have at least these four.

To _intersect_ these two types, we _unioned_ their properties. We can see this in code using &#x60;keyof&#x60;:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;ada
type KN &#x3D; {} &amp; keyof NamedPoint;
&#x2F;&#x2F;   ^? type KN &#x3D; &quot;name&quot; | &quot;x&quot; | &quot;y&quot;
type K3 &#x3D; {} &amp; keyof Point3D;
&#x2F;&#x2F;   ^? type K3 &#x3D; &quot;x&quot; | &quot;y&quot; | &quot;z&quot;
type KI &#x3D; keyof (NamedPoint &amp; Point3D);
&#x2F;&#x2F;   ^? type KI &#x3D; &quot;name&quot; | &quot;x&quot; | &quot;y&quot; | &quot;z&quot;
type KU &#x3D; (keyof NamedPoint) | (keyof Point3D)
&#x2F;&#x2F;   ^? type KU &#x3D; &quot;name&quot; | &quot;x&quot; | &quot;y&quot; | &quot;z&quot;

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

So &#x60;keyof (A&amp;B) &#x3D; (keyof A) | (keyof B)&#x60;!

(The weird &#x60;{} &amp;&#x60; forces TypeScript to print out the results of &#x60;keyof&#x60;. I [wish](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.effectivetypescript.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;02&#x2F;25&#x2F;gentips-4-display&#x2F;#Exclude-lt-keyof-T-never-gt) this weren&#39;t necessary.)

What about the other relationship, &#x60;keyof (A|B)&#x60;? &#x60;keyof T&#x60; will only include a property if TypeScript can be sure that it will be present on values assignable to &#x60;T&#x60; (with a caveat, see below).

Again, let&#39;s make this more concrete with some examples:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;yaml
const nyc: NamedPoint &#x3D; {
  name: &#39;New York&#39;,
  x: -73,
  y: 40,
};
const pythagoras: Point3D &#x3D; {
  x: 3,
  y: 4,
  z: 5,
};

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

To be assignable to &#x60;A|B&#x60;, a value must be assignable to either &#x60;A&#x60; or &#x60;B&#x60; (or both!). So these values are both assignable to &#x60;NamedPoint | Point3D&#x60;:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;actionscript
const u1: NamedPoint | Point3D &#x3D; nyc; &#x2F;&#x2F; ok
const u2: NamedPoint | Point3D &#x3D; pythagoras; &#x2F;&#x2F; ok

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

Thinking about &#x60;keyof&#x60;, which properties belong to both those objects? It&#39;s just &#x60;&quot;x&quot;&#x60; and &#x60;&quot;y&quot;&#x60;. And that&#39;s &#x60;keyof&#x60; for the union type:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;elm
type KU &#x3D; keyof (NamedPoint | Point3D)
&#x2F;&#x2F;   ^? type KU &#x3D; &quot;x&quot; | &quot;y&quot;
type IK &#x3D; (keyof NamedPoint) &amp; (keyof Point3D)
&#x2F;&#x2F;   ^? type IK &#x3D; &quot;x&quot; | &quot;y&quot;

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

So &#x60;keyof (A|B) &#x3D; (keyof A) &amp; (keyof B)&#x60; and the equation holds.

Hopefully working through these examples with some concrete types makes the equations clearer. I really like them because they&#39;re concise but still manage to say a lot about how types work in TypeScript.

I mentioned one caveat, and it has to do with optional fields:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;ada
interface PartialPoint {
  x: number;
  y?: number;
}
type KP &#x3D; {} &amp; keyof PartialPoint;
&#x2F;&#x2F;   ^? type KP &#x3D; &quot;x&quot; | &quot;y&quot;
const justX: PartialPoint &#x3D; { x: 10 };

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

&#x60;justX&#x60; is assignable to &#x60;PartialPoint&#x60;, but it doesn&#39;t have a &#x60;y&#x60; property, which you&#39;d expect given the &#x60;keyof&#x60;.

Optional fields are a little strange when you think about types in a set-theoretic way. On the one hand, it&#39;s surprising that &#x60;keyof PartialPoint&#x60; includes &#x60;&quot;y&quot;&#x60; because values needn&#39;t have that property. On the other hand, it would be incredibly annoying if it didn&#39;t because &#x60;keyof&#x60; is so often used with [mapped types](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.typescriptlang.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;handbook&#x2F;2&#x2F;mapped-types.html), and you&#39;d really like to map over all the fields, not just the required ones.

At the end of the day, what&#39;s the difference between these two types?

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;routeros
interface JustX {
  x: number;
}
interface XMaybeY {
  x: number;
  y?: unknown;
}

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

I&#39;ll cryptically say &quot;not much!&quot; and leave it at that!
