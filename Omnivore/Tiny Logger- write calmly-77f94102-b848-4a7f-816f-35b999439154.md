### [Billie Eilish](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tinylogger.com&#x2F;max&#x2F;pgJbzGJzETrisblM)

A few months ago I was watching the Oscars when Billie Eilish won Best Original Song for &quot;What Was I Made For?&quot; from Barbie. Her [live performance](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;1rL1EHELPAk) was stunning, and when I listened to the song again a few days later, I was struck by how well-written and beautifully produced it was. I vaguely knew Billie is Very Famous and has a kinda freaky vibe, and that her older brother Finneas is an acclaimed up-and-coming producer with a solo record. But, I had assumed their music was edgy, over-produced pop and never gave it a chance. Hearing &quot;What Was I Made For&quot; made me do a double take. I started watching their [interviews](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;mewdcHIvMmA) on YouTube, and was immediately drawn in by their creativity and commitment to great production. Although most people are familiar with the teenage sensation Billie Eilish, she and Finneas collaborate side by side on almost everything. Finneas is a masterful engineer and producer who assembles precise, quirky, minimal arrangements that showcase Billie&#39;s unreal voice. Billie is an uncompromising artist with an unreal voice, pushing boundaries in her lyrics, vocal arrangements, and music videos. The two recorded their first album in their childhood bedroom, and continue to put out pure sonic goodness. In interviews, artists often talk about vague inspirations or feign humility. Instead, Billie says &quot;I did 100 vocal takes to get this phrase just right&quot; as Finneas pulls up the [Logic](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;logic-pro&#x2F;) session and talks through how he made production choices, often squeezing all he can from stock plugins. So, what kind of music do they make? It&#39;s not hard to like Eilish&#39;s first hit [Ocean Eyes](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soundcloud.com&#x2F;billieeilish&#x2F;ocean-eyes), recorded when Billie was 13 or 14 (!) or her mega-hit [Bad Guy](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soundcloud.com&#x2F;billieeilish&#x2F;bad-guy), which won all the awards (_duh_). I also really like [Bury A Friend](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;HUHC9tYz8ik) and [ilomilo](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;-e7wiyNO2us) from her first album, along with a lot of Finneas&#39;s solo work: [Medieval](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;Lg9LBTaysCI&amp;ab%5Fchannel&#x3D;FINNEASVEVO) and [I Lost a Friend](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;Bii-MYXrMxk&amp;ab%5Fchannel&#x3D;FINNEAS-Topic). Inspired by the interviews and their work, I watched [&quot;The World&#39;s a Little Blurry&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;AyWYWJ8hAqc&amp;t&#x3D;33s&amp;ab%5Fchannel&#x3D;AppleUK), an Apple TV documentary that follows their journey from the early days to worldwide fame. It&#39;s a really enjoyable piece of cinema, but it walks a fine line. Parts of it feel intimate and almost relatable: we get a look into their creative process, family arguments, shin splints, hordes of shrieking teenage fans, frustration, exhaustion, self-doubt, and all. But draped over every tender scene is a vague sense that these are the moments we&#39;re allowed to see, that they&#39;ve chosen to share. And that&#39;s my sense with _Billie Eilish_, the brand: her team carefully packages Billie&#39;s genuine [no-fucks-given weirdness](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;PlQQ5) in top-notch marketing that makes that weirdness accessible to everyone. There&#39;s a lot more to talk about here: is she a [nepo baby](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thethings.com&#x2F;is-billie-eilish-a-nepo-baby&#x2F;) or [industry plant](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bubblegumclub.co.za&#x2F;music&#x2F;industry-plants-and-what-they-mean&#x2F;)? What does it even mean to be authentic in music? But that&#39;s a topic for someone else&#39;s post. In short, my own view was shaped by YouTuber Andrew Huang&#39;s thoughts on branding [from his excellent book](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B0C7RQHH8R?ref&#x3D;yb%5Fqv%5Fov%5Fkndl%5Fdp%5Frw):

But what are art and performance anyway, if not fabrications? The line between authentic and inauthentic can shift wildly... it&#39;s a gross oversimplification to think we each have only one way we _really_ are and the rest must be somehow put on.

I realized that I could never share all of myself... so, no matter how I approached it, my audience would always be getting small slices here and there. Why not help people understand a bit better how those pieces fit together? And further, wasn&#39;t this kind of selective representation true of... everything? ... Art itself is a selective process -- all the editing and polishing, removing what&#39;s unnecessary. Why shouldn&#39;t our presentation and promotion of it be any less refined?

Branding aside, Billie Eilish&#39;s music continues to evolve. Her latest album, Hit Me Hard and Soft, has radio-ready, naughty hits like [Lunch](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soundcloud.com&#x2F;billieeilish&#x2F;lunch), along with the significantly more mature, soulful masterpiece [The Greatest](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;hDtGsVB3y3I). I think Billie has some incredible work in store for us in the years to come.

At the end of the day, I like the music Billie and Finneas make, but I **love** how they make it. I don&#39;t want to listen to their stuff every day and I don&#39;t really want to sound like them, but I do want to have the same relationship with the craft they do. I want to reach for the same level of originality and excellence they do. And exploring this great new corner of music has seriously sparked my own songwriting. Whenever I stumble on another one of their [conversations](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;3Qd5Pmh5ZSI) or [stripped-down performances](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;kl1Jhw10bpA), I feel inspired to jump back into Logic. As a result, I&#39;ve been writing more, listening to more stuff, getting deeper into my tools, and finishing more music. More on that soon!
