### [Three kinds of music I work to](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tinylogger.com&#x2F;max&#x2F;sFIMDy6rapP5Htci)

When I need to focus, I usually put on my headphones and listen to one of three things, depending on how cognitively taxing the work is: 1\. If the task is well-defined and doesn&#39;t require a lot of hard thinking, I put on a [Spotify playlist](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;open.spotify.com&#x2F;playlist&#x2F;7IUelLVfvzXjW1x5RYbSqV?si&#x3D;bdd9bf34a89b4f71) of mostly electronic tracks. This gets my heart rate up, I bop along, and the task feels more fun. This applies to things like making gifs, tweaking a website UI, building a spreadsheet, and so on. 2\. If the work is moderately challenging or stressful, I put on chillhop: you know, [Lofi Beats To Study To](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;jfKfPfyJRdk&amp;ab%5Fchannel&#x3D;LofiGirl) type stuff. I also have a [Spotify playlist](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;open.spotify.com&#x2F;playlist&#x2F;0sWy3gVwqe9gFtjfa7WtqE?si&#x3D;a43ccab868044e83) for this, but [any lo fi youtube channel](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;pm6qy%5F9E0rY) will do. This has the opposite effect to #1: it calms me down and helps me ease into the work. I listen to chillhop for any important, routine work that needs my attention: coding, reading, editing, writing. 3\. If I need think really hard or learn new information, I put on white noise. I prefer this to working in silence. It amps up the intensity of the moment in just the right way, blocks everything else out, and I can focus much better.
