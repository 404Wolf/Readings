### [When do you stop drawing?](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tinylogger.com&#x2F;max&#x2F;iAvktzYRMlC047sd)

They say that people tend to be creative in multiple ways. I mainly write words and music, but also dabble in photography, sketching building geometry, and making wire sculptures. But one art that&#39;s always mystified me is visual art. Watching an artist at work feels like wizardry. With a stroke of the brush, lines become a face, paint becomes skin, repeated strokes become a reflection in the lake. I&#39;m sure the artist is applying a technique, just as I emulate thunder with a timpani roll, or catch your attention with a strong lede. But to the uninitiated, following a technique is like reciting an incantation. When I see a painting [come to life](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tinylogger.com&#x2F;max&#x2F;%28https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;wS23qF-toTA%29), I often find myself thinking, &quot;ooh, that looks great!&quot; But then, to my surprise, the artist continues working. Sometimes the additional detail adds subtlety I didn&#39;t realize the work needed, but the additions often feel superfluous and I prefer the simpler version. This doesn&#39;t happen with music production videos. When a composer says &quot;now we&#39;ll apply compression,&quot; or &quot;let&#39;s double that string line in the flutes&quot;, I understand and usually agree with their thinking. But in visual art, I can&#39;t tell what the work is missing, and I don&#39;t have an eye for subtlety. If the shape looks like a horse, I&#39;m already impressed! If the trees are a pleasant green, I don&#39;t yearn for more variation in the leaves. I like [straightforward works](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metmuseum.org&#x2F;art&#x2F;collection&#x2F;search&#x2F;10786?pos&#x3D;6) with bold colors and clean, [realistic](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metmuseum.org&#x2F;art&#x2F;collection&#x2F;search&#x2F;12800?pos&#x3D;7) shapes. Spending twenty minutes to get to that point, and then hours futzing with the little details confuses me. Of course, both are perfectly fine art. In music, we use a combination of chords&#x2F;melody&#x2F;rhythm to get the vision across (analogous to shapes and colors), and we can also use one or two instruments for a more barebones, minimal piece. Or, we can expand the instrumentation, ornamentation, and audio processing for greater expression. In music, I have the skills and background to appreciate and crave subtlety. But when friends say &quot;I&#39;m not _cultured_ enough for the symphony; I don&#39;t know what to listen for&quot;, I always tell them it&#39;s the composer&#39;s and the conductor&#39;s job to captivate them. You shouldn&#39;t need a music degree to appreciate good music. Knowledge should enhance your experience, but it shouldn&#39;t be a pre-requisite. I don&#39;t know if my preference for more digestible art comes from having taste or not having knowledge. And although taking a few painting lessons might be a good experience one day, I&#39;d rather invest that time getting better at music. Until then, I&#39;ll continue to be impressed when someone can draw a horse, amazed when they can give it a flowing mane, and skeptical when they spend the next forty minutes getting the shadows just right.
