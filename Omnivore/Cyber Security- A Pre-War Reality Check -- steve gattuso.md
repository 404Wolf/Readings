This article seemed to be reiterating many of the ideas that the [permacomputing](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;permacomputing.net&#x2F;) community has been talking about for years now, though speaking through the lens of war rather than climate collapse.

Things like our tech stack being too tall and complex for anybody to understand. Or the fact that we’ve outsourced much of the expertise required to maintain the complex systems that critical infrastructure relies upon. Or our tendency to choose shiny yet brittle tech-heavy solutions to problems rather than simple and robust ones.

While I’m not thrilled that resilience seems to garner more attention through the pretext of war rather than climate, perhaps this is a means of communicating these ideas in a way that more people will understand. Or at least act as a bridge to open up people’s minds to these ideas, which we can then use to get people on board towards resilience in the context of sustainability. I appreciated that the author threw a little nugget of this into the article:

&gt; Even if you are such a diehard pacifist that you are convinced that it’s never going to happen, you can just imagine that I’m talking about robustness in the face of climate change.

I’m a Northeasterner old enough to remember [2003 blackout](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Northeast%5Fblackout%5Fof%5F2003), which knocked out power for a week. It wasn’t the end of the world at the time, but I wonder how I’d fare nowadays if something similar (or more destructive) were to happen. Decades of relative reliability have me very dependent on the modern tech stack for not just my personal life, but also my livelihood as a tech worker.

All of this makes me half-jokingly wonder if improving my ability to bake bread or repair bikes could _really_ come in handy one day.
