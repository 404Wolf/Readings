Although my background is solidly in visual art, I don’t know much color theory. Recently, my best results in this area have been generated by throwing photos with interesting colors in Figma and parsing out the colors into tiles.

## Dark Mode for this Blog

During covid I randomly happened upon this refraction of a sunset through a glass of water I was drinking and I thought wow, those colors are incredible! Four years later, I found something to do with them:

## Light Mode for this Blog

The color inspiration for the light mode of this blog is a photo of pizza I made at my friend[ Div’s](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shortdiv.com&#x2F;) that was taken by my room mate [Alana](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;trippinalana&#x2F;). I thought the colors were sort of interesting, and was pleasantly surprised to find that a pizza-flavored theme is quite cozy and, dare I say tasty?
