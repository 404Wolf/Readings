[  Olu Online ](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;) 

[blog](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;blog) [about](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;about) [projects](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;projects) [contact me](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;contact) [buy me a coffee&#x2F;domain&#x2F;etc](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;coffee) [now](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;now) [notes](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.olu.online&#x2F;)

* updated my description cloud on the front page to be a little less serious. important work lol.
* uploaded the beginning of my [notes](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.olu.online&#x2F;) site, it&#39;s [quartz](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quartz.jzhao.xyz&#x2F;) with styling changes. Let me know if the [font](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;superpencil.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;blog&#x2F;hello-johto-sans) is hard to read; I enjoy it but am unsure if I should just stick to [Fira Code](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fonts.google.com&#x2F;specimen&#x2F;Fira+Code). Messing around with quartz has been so interesting and I hope to get more involved with the coding side of PKM&#x2F;note-taking&#x2F;tools for thought, they&#39;re such interesting front-end challenges.
* daily pages — my word for what is usually knows as [morning pages](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;juliacameronlive.com&#x2F;basic-tools&#x2F;morning-pages&#x2F;) — which I&#39;ve been doing for 45 days now (if i complete them today) are going okay? Yesterday and the day before were a struggle. I use [750 words](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;new.750words.com&#x2F;) which is what it sounds like in length, and sometimes I want to write &quot;today was okay, isn&#39;t it?&quot; and be done with writing but I am a sucker for a streak. Probably need to stop doing them before bed.
* I do a gratitude thing I made up based on an Alice in Wonderland quote; at least six impossible things happen every day and I list the ones from the day before each day in [Capacities](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;capacities.io&#x2F;).

&gt; “Alice laughed. &#39;There&#39;s no use trying,&#39; she said. &#39;One can&#39;t believe impossible things.&#39;
&gt; 
&gt; I daresay you haven&#39;t had much practice,&#39; said the Queen. &#39;When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I&#39;ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.

* Feeling really inspired by [Gathering Structures](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maggieappleton.com&#x2F;gathering-structures) by Maggie Appleton, and then despairing of the state of search engines that I can&#39;t find much that&#39;s not focused on businesses on setting up online communities. Will probably ask on all the [social media](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;contact) after finishing this.
* On search engines: I&#39;ve been trying out [Kagi](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kagi.com&#x2F;) and enjoy the lenses but wonder if there&#39;s better search engines for indie web stuff.
* Thinking about zines and whether I want to make one (or several) still.
* Really enjoying the kith, kin and community I have, and thinking about ways to &quot;give back&quot; and contribute to the world, as ever. I think I have more of an idea of the things I can and should do now. Really glad I got over my effective altruism phase a while ago; things were bad but seems to have gotten worse with the AI boom.
* Decided to stop trying to search for a useful way of organising private notes and just try to rely on great search and good capture habits.
