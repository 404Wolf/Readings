[Blog](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;blog) [About](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;about) [Projects](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;projects) [Contact me](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;contact) [Buy me a coffee&#x2F;domain&#x2F;etc](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;coffee) [Youtube](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@oluOnline) [Now](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;now)

* My next Youtube video is shaping up slowly, I was hoping to have it out by the end of last month but surprise, it&#39;s a series (no one is surprised but me. everything is a series if I&#39;m making it). If you&#39;re reading this and are a self-taught video editing genius (especially if you use DaVinci Resolve!) hit me up, I am confused how I improve my skills after a certain point. Gonna have to work out how to break up my menagerie of depressing graphs without just putting joke graphs in as it doesn&#39;t match the tone I think? It&#39;s the start of the [digital divide&#x2F;who isn&#39;t online](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;social.gfsc.studio&#x2F;@oluOnline&#x2F;112416671608688455) series.

![A graph with a y axis of &quot;who cares&quot; and an x axis of &quot;sick of graphs&quot;. a line is plotted on the graph with one dot highlighted, which is labelled &quot;shut up&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app&#x2F;0x0,stPhH4kVX73Tm4sddp3kR-PA_aQhoF0GhskKMkHcCuLs&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com&#x2F;oluonline-1717366537-0.png)

* After talking a bit with a friend about my only spiritual practice being that of trying to cultivate awe, I was reminded about my whole [technopagan](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;social.gfsc.studio&#x2F;@oluOnline&#x2F;111705084151757819)belief&#x2F;bit (and truly what is the difference, between a fervently held belief and a bit you won&#39;t stop doing? nothing, next question). I was starting to make a wheel of the year which incorporates a lot more technological&#x2F;tool based awe and gratitude into it, hopefully will finish that off this week. Gonna start reading &quot;Losing Eden: Why Our Minds Need the Wild&quot; by Lucy Jones after it was mentioned in a podcast episode recommended during this discussion.
* Trying to play a game of rapid online chess a day this week. Trying to persuade myself it will be a rated game, 152 ELO on chess.com or no.
* Daily (morning was ambitious lol) pages are still going strong I think I hit thirty days yesterday! Very happy, long may it continue.
* Trying to work out if I want to post to Substack much after all. I think if I&#39;m trying to build online community primarily why the hell not, but I also wonder if people will be tired of my incessant chatter with three windows + social media into my mind.
* Thinking about &quot;neurodivergence&#x2F;ND&quot; and why I always feel a bit skeeved out by the term despite all my autism, historical divides between the mad&#x2F;mentally ill and physically disabled communities, whether labels matter, etc.
* Might start ukulele lessons shortly and a friend asked if I had dyspraxia and, whilst I am unsure, it took me a few beats to realise &quot;oh yeah, being dyspraxic would make instruments hard in theory&quot;. Learnt names for all the different types of dyspraxia and read a few helpful and&#x2F;or upsetting posts on Reddit on r&#x2F;dyspraxia, mild recommend.
* I really want to get an electric scooter but given possible dyspraxia and general lack of spatial and body awareness I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s a very bad idea.
* Excited to start getting into stretching, wholehearted recommend for [Adam Richardson](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instagram.com&#x2F;aadamrichardson&#x2F;), he has a really approachable manner and isn&#39;t too broey about the whole thing.
