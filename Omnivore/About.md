## Hi, I‚Äôm Elijah!

![](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app&#x2F;0x0,s-r0Zh4vFanEwCK-YU3gQ4jJ2Bv2y9l4Ouh_OV_PH7SE&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elijer.github.io&#x2F;garden&#x2F;attachments&#x2F;yoohoo.jpeg)

&gt; üì∏ by Jose Oliva Martinez [@thatonejackedmexican](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;thatonejackedmexican&#x2F;)

I‚Äôm an artist, a programmer, and an enthusiast of running around in the woods and climbing things. I am from Arlington Virginia, but have spent the last few years in Memphis, TN, and recently relocated to NYC. Ask me about Peace Corps, converting a van into a home, or Jenny Odell‚Äôs excellent book [‚ÄúHow to Do Nothing‚Äù](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;42771901-how-to-do-nothing).

I created this blog as a low-pressure way to chronicle my ideas, art, and experiences. The added bonus is that it‚Äôs also a way for me to share them! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out at elijahclimbs at gmail dot com.
