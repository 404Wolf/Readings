More in my [series](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metafilter.com&#x2F;202895&#x2F;new-perspective-on-things-by-looking-at-your-fundamental-assumptions) curating work by finance expert Daniel Davies, this time focusing on academia and on the cultures and norms of research in general. In [&quot;why i am (still after all) an economist&quot; (2023)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;backofmind.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;why-i-am-still-after-all-an-economist), he asks, &quot;Is there anything that is actually definitional, something that you have to believe or you’re not an economist?&quot; and offers his answer, which is that (I&#39;d summarize) economics treats historical facts as descriptive but not necessarily prescriptive.

(As background on Davies&#39;s own educational history: [he did the Philosophy, Politics and Economics course at Oxford University](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;backofmind.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;practical-men-with-practical-spreadsheets), and then [London Business School&#39;s MSc in Finance](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.danieldavies.com&#x2F;2005&#x2F;07&#x2F;d-squared-digest-one-minute-mba-part-2.html) since it [&quot;was substantially cheaper&quot; than an MBA](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;global&#x2F;2008&#x2F;jun&#x2F;03&#x2F;danieldavies).)

[&quot;Creative arts and investing in systems&quot;, 2019](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;11&#x2F;creative-arts-and-investing-in-systems&#x2F;): &quot;one of the important outputs of a thriving fringe theatre scene is an educated and critical _audience_, which is the hidden crucial competitive advantage that the British media industry enjoys over most of its competitors.&quot;

[&quot;This year&#39;s A-level results are a fiasco – but the system was already broken&quot; (August 2020)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;2020&#x2F;aug&#x2F;15&#x2F;a-level-results-system-ofqual-england-exam-marking): &quot;when we see a big gap between the teachers’ predicted grades, and the &#39;adjusted&#39; versions meant to bring those grades into line with previous years’ exam results, why would we necessarily believe that it was the teachers who were wrong and the exam results that were right?&quot; (Related: [&quot;Grade inflation: It looks as though A-levels have got easier over the last 20 years, but perhaps it&#39;s a case of teachers increasing their productivity.&quot; (2007)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;2007&#x2F;aug&#x2F;15&#x2F;gradeinflation)

(Among them: &quot;Senior academics falsely claiming authorship&quot;.)

&gt; This isn’t a specific issue about financial sector corruption. It’s a general trend, one of gradual social re-assessment of whether the fiddles and skeletons of the past are going to be tolerated in the future.....
&gt; 
&gt; The things that all these kind of scandals have in common are a) common knowledge – they tend to be practices that everyone in the sector in question knows about, but nobody has really considered what they might look like to an outsider, and b) because of this, ubiquity – there is always a mass of evidence, because nobody in the past has seen it as something worth covering up.

Davies wrote a long-form review of _Freakonomics_ between 2005 and 2009: [Part 1](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.danieldavies.com&#x2F;2005&#x2F;11&#x2F;long-awaited-freakonomics-post-this-is.html), [Part 2, &quot;The Heterodox Theory of the Criminal Firm&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.danieldavies.com&#x2F;2006&#x2F;03&#x2F;freakonomics-review-part-2-heterodox.html), [Part 3, &quot;Natural experiments ain&#39;t so Freaking Natural&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.danieldavies.com&#x2F;2007&#x2F;01&#x2F;this-has-been-so-absurdly-trailed-it.html) (and [addenda](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.danieldavies.com&#x2F;2005&#x2F;12&#x2F;if-this-is-normal-science-i-want-my.html)), [Part 4](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.danieldavies.com&#x2F;2007&#x2F;09&#x2F;freakiology-yes-folks-its-part-4-of.html), and [Part 5, &quot;How Freaked is Economics?&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.danieldavies.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;10&#x2F;hell-freezes-over-yes-folks-its-last.html). I never read _Freakonomics_ and the most engaging part of the series, to me, is Part 4, which includes:

&gt; I&#39;ve often joked that neoclassical economics and evolutionary psychology are unusual among social science fields because they&#39;re the only areas where you can gravely insult someone by agreeing with their theory (by telling an economist that he&#39;s only saying what he&#39;s saying because he&#39;s well paid for doing so, or telling an EP type that his latest paper is simply an attempt to draw attention to himself and gain status).....
&gt; 
&gt; There are a hell of a lot of &quot;you scratch my back and I&#39;ll scratch yours&quot; arrangements in the world. Some are illegal, some are disreputable, some are more-or-less standard and some are pretty much constitutive of what it is to behave honourably.

**Humor and satire**

[on the Ayn Rand &amp; charity beat in 2008](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crookedtimber.org&#x2F;2008&#x2F;04&#x2F;11&#x2F;i-would-like-to-thank-my-parents-ayn-rand-and-jesus&#x2F;), Davies notes:

&gt; A large charitable foundation attached to a bank has given the University of North Carolina Charlotte, among others a donation in return for making “Atlas Shrugged” compulsory reading.... This is essentially a bribe to the university and as far as I can see, taking a bribe to compromise your own vision of an undergraduate reading list doesn’t fit in particularly well with Rand’s particular ethics of self-reliance and independent thought.

I&#39;m not always the best at detecting dry humor, but I think [&quot;A Solution To The Adjunct Problem&quot; (2003)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.danieldavies.com&#x2F;2003&#x2F;07&#x2F;solution-to-adjunct-problem-ok-people.html) was satire, suggesting that &quot;Universities should sell their professorships, at whatever price the market will bear&quot; -- just as one used to be able to buy or sell British Army officer commissions.

And, again somewhat satirically, I think, [&quot;Religious education in schools is the cornerstone of a secular society, because it puts children off religion for life.&quot; (2006)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;2006&#x2F;nov&#x2F;28&#x2F;thelessonslearned)
