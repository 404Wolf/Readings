# Let‚Äôs All Agree to Use Seeds as ML-KEM Keys

Last week, NIST published the final version of the ML-KEM[\[1\]](#fn1) specification, [FIPS 203](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;csrc.nist.gov&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;fips&#x2F;203&#x2F;final?ref&#x3D;words.filippo.io). One change from the draft is that the final document explicitly allows storing the private decapsulation key as a _seed_. This is a plea to the cryptography engineering community: let‚Äôs all agree to only use seeds as the storage format of ML-KEM keys, and forget that a serialized format for expanded decapsulation keys even exists.

Seeds have multiple advantages. The most obvious is size: a seed is 64 bytes, while an expanded decapsulation key is 1 632, 2 400, or 3 168 bytes depending on the ML-KEM parameter set.

More importantly, though, a 64-byte seed is always valid, while an expanded decapsulation key needs to be _validated_. FIPS 203, Section 7.3, requires the following check

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;angelscript
H(dk[384ùëò : 768ùëò + 32])) &#x3D;&#x3D; dk[768ùëò + 32 : 768ùëò + 64]

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

to ensure two parts of the input key are consistent: the pre-computed hash of the encapsulation key, and the encapsulation key itself.

That‚Äôs not all, though. The decapsulation key expanded format is

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;ruby
ByteEncode‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ(s) || ByteEncode‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ(t) || œÅ || H(ekPKE) || z

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

where _s_ and _t_ are vectors of [NTT elements](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;words.filippo.io&#x2F;dispatches&#x2F;kyber-math&#x2F;). An NTT element is in turn a vector of field elements, and a field element is a number between zero and 3 329, encoded as a 16-bit integer. What if an encoded field element is higher than 3 329? It‚Äôs invalid! What then? Well. If you find one in an _encapsulation key_ you are required to reject it by FIPS 203, Section 7.2\. But what if you find it in the encapsulation key that‚Äôs part of a decapsulation key (the _t_ value)? And what if you find it in a different part of a decapsulation key (the _s_ value)? The spec doesn‚Äôt say!

This whole can of worms just stays on the shelf with seeds, because it‚Äôs the implementation itself that derives _s_, _t_, and _H(ekPKE)_, so it can be certain they are valid.

Ok, so seeds are smaller and simpler, reducing the margin for error, but are they expensive? They are not, to the point that loading the expanded decapsulation key over a Gigabit link is almost as expensive as expanding a seed[\[2\]](#fn2), but most importantly it doesn‚Äôt matter!

Keys have implicitly two representations: one on the wire, one in memory. The latter can include precomputed values to enable faster operations and doesn&#39;t need a fixed bytes format. The cost of going from one to the other‚Äîthe cost of seed expansion‚Äîis not important for private keys: either keys are ephemeral, in which case they can go straight into the in-memory representation, or they are reused a lot, in which case the deserialization cost is amortized.

The ML-KEM expanded decapsulation key format is actually not even a good in-memory format, because it doesn‚Äôt include the full expanded matrix A but its seed œÅ. It‚Äôs a weird in-between where some values are expanded (so you need to validate them) but some others are not (so you need to expand them).

Seeds have obvious advantages and are explicitly allowed by the specification, so we‚Äôll definitely see them used in the wild. If we _also_ support the expanded format, we‚Äôre going to see interoperability issues, and we‚Äôll have to carry all the complexity of both code paths. Let‚Äôs just not.

Speaking of interoperability, FIPS 203 does a great job of specifying everything in terms of byte sequences[\[3\]](#fn3)‚Ä¶ _except_ the seed, which is defined as _‚Äå(d, z)_. I think every implementation I‚Äôve seen just stores them by concatenating [\[4\]](#fn4) them as a 64-byte buffer, so hopefully we can all agree on that. If anyone suggests an ASN.1 SEQUENCE of BIT STRINGs or whatever I _will_ quit.

~~To really put this to rest, we‚Äôre going to need (sooner rather than later!) a specification like [RFC 8410](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;info&#x2F;rfc8410?ref&#x3D;words.filippo.io) which specifies the key format and assigns OIDs for use in e.g. PKCS #8\. Interestingly, the OID arc used by RFC 8410 for Ed25519, 1.3.101, is now [managed as an IANA registry](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iana.org&#x2F;assignments&#x2F;smi-numbers&#x2F;smi-numbers.xhtml?ref&#x3D;words.filippo.io#smi-numbers-1.3.101) with policy [Specification Required](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc8126?ref&#x3D;words.filippo.io#section-4.6), _not_ RFC Required. See [RFC 8411](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;info&#x2F;rfc8411?ref&#x3D;words.filippo.io). That means that anyone could make e.g. a [C2SP](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;c2sp.org&#x2F;?ref&#x3D;words.filippo.io) document referencing FIPS 203 and request OID assignments for ML-KEM. Unless work is already underway to assign OIDs, this might very well be the fastest path, and the longer we wait the more we risk ecosystem fractures.~~

**EDIT** (minutes after pressing send): Well, scratch all that, I was a day behind on my mailing lists inbox and I just saw that NIST has published [OIDs for all ML-KEM parameters](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;csrc.nist.gov&#x2F;projects&#x2F;computer-security-objects-register&#x2F;algorithm-registration?ref&#x3D;words.filippo.io) and linked to [draft-ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates-03](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ietf.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;id&#x2F;draft-ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates-03.html?ref&#x3D;words.filippo.io) for the key format specification. The &quot;Private Key Format&quot; section of that draft doesn&#39;t say what the actual private key format is, and hopefully it will land on 64-byte seeds.

Concretely, for implementations, I am suggesting not implementing expanded key parsing and validation at all, or relegating it to an internal function like the [derandomized](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;words.filippo.io&#x2F;dispatches&#x2F;avoid-the-randomness-from-the-sky&#x2F;) variants, not exposed in the public API. That‚Äôs [what I did for filippo.io&#x2F;mlkem768](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FiloSottile&#x2F;mlkem768&#x2F;compare&#x2F;55afeac9504dbb4df06844821b0a33ad8c301879...859a9b3f2ff665591a5b659d55aaf0b4111dc171?ref&#x3D;words.filippo.io) and probably what we will do for the Go standard library. We will also ensure that the test vectors in [CCTV](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;c2sp.org&#x2F;CCTV&#x2F;ML-KEM?ref&#x3D;words.filippo.io) and [Wycheproof](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;C2SP&#x2F;wycheproof?ref&#x3D;words.filippo.io) don‚Äôt require it (i.e. that they provide seeds as inputs). This will make it hard or impossible to test issues that require malformed decapsulation keys _but that‚Äôs the point_: if you don‚Äôt expose the API you don‚Äôt need to test its failure cases. All other vectors should be reproducible by bruteforcing seeds.[\[5\]](#fn5)

## The picture

In Madeira there is this incredible forest, [Fanal](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;visitmadeira.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;what-to-do&#x2F;nature-seekers&#x2F;laurissilva-forest&#x2F;fanal&#x2F;?ref&#x3D;words.filippo.io), full of centenary twisty trees in a mysterious eery atmosphere. One of a few places, along with Barcelona, that are best experienced with the fog. (I grew up in the Padan Plain, and was recently almost ran over by a pack of spooked cows in the thick fog driving a motorcycle up the Matese Apennines, don‚Äôt @ me about fog.)

1. ML-KEM, f.k.a. Kyber, is a post-quantum key exchange mechanism, which we can use alongside or in place of Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman to protect encrypted data from future quantum computers. [‚Ü©Ô∏é](#fnref1)
2. Expanding a seed on my M2 takes 40¬µs, loading 2 400 bytes over Gigabit takes 19¬µs. This is not a fair comparison, though: after you load the expanded key you still need to check the hash and expand the A matrix, both of which you would have done ‚Äúfor free‚Äù as part of expanding the seeds. [‚Ü©Ô∏é](#fnref2)
3. Unironically, maybe _the_ most important progress of cryptography engineering in the last twenty years has been transitioning to specifying APIs in terms of bytes. Everything starts and ends as bytes, if you write a specification in terms of ‚Äúintegers modulo P‚Äù or whatever, it just means implementations will YOLO the deserialization, validation, and serialization parts of the spec. [‚Ü©Ô∏é](#fnref3)
4. X-Wing [briefly had them reversed](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dconnolly&#x2F;draft-connolly-cfrg-xwing-kem&#x2F;commit&#x2F;ae7e913857b95976f32879a0f6fd712b44ab0d3c?ref&#x3D;words.filippo.io), highlighting the importance of specifying all the way to bytes. [‚Ü©Ô∏é](#fnref4)
5. I strongly believe that edge cases should be either so common that they can be easily tested with random inputs (ideally &gt; 2‚Åª¬π‚Å∂ chance, but anything &gt; 2‚Åª‚Å¥‚Å∞ we‚Äôll bruteforce a vector for) or so unlikely that they can be ignored and replaced with a &#x60;exit(1)&#x60; (&lt; 2‚Åª¬π¬≤‚Å∞ chance). ML-KEM seems to match this ideal. [‚Ü©Ô∏é](#fnref5)
