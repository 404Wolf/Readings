Another [#happy](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writing.natwelch.com&#x2F;tag&#x2F;happy) post. I hope everyone is doing well.

Read

* [Uber&#39;s Crazy YOLO App Rewrite](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.pragmaticengineer.com&#x2F;uber-app-rewrite-yolo&#x2F;) is a story of a terrible sounding rewrite. We did a big rewrite last year, and it was thankfully nothing like this.
* [Making Truth Social Comply With The AGPL](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boehs.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;truth-social) is just an interesting walkthrough of someone trying to enforce a license on open source software.
* [Stop Acting Like You&#39;re Famous](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ajkprojects.com&#x2F;stopactinglikeyourefamous) is great advice on how to make your leisure activities more enjoyable.
* [HiSense TV crashes persons computer](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cohost.org&#x2F;bravemule&#x2F;post&#x2F;5638478-empty). What a fun little mystery bug. Computers were a mistake.

Listen

* [Dropbox CEO on Decoder Podcast](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;24128606&#x2F;dropbox-drew-houston-ai-remote-work-virtual-organization) was an interesting dive into the current state of remote work. I&#39;m not sure I agree with everything he says, but it&#39;s interesting to hear his perspective.

Watch

* I watched most of Fallout. Look, the show is good. It&#39;s a bit terrifying, disgusting and a little funny. Mostly I&#39;m just amazed they made such a great adaptation.

Play

* I was in London over the weekend helping Mel find a place to live for the year. Fun to be back in the city and wandering around.
