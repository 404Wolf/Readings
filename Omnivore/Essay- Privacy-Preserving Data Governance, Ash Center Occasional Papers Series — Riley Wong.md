Published an essay with the [Harvard Kennedy School Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ash.harvard.edu&#x2F;) on some recent research and ideas on privacy-preserving data governance, covering: 

* how emerging privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) can serve vulnerable communities such as sex workers;
* how privacy-preserving data collectives can enable community power;
* how interfaces for data consent can create infrastructure for community agency;
* models of access, usability, and responsibility over “ownership;” stewardship, consent, and agency over “control;”
* community research and co-design.
