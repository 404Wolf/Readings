[#happy](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writing.natwelch.com&#x2F;tag&#x2F;happy) time.

Watch

* I watched [3 Body Problem](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;3%5FBody%5FProblem%5F%28TV%5Fseries%29) and it was really thrilling. Excited for the next season. Great Science Fiction with a lot of unique ideas.
* The [Roadhouse](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Road%5FHouse%5F%282024%5Ffilm%29) remake was a fun and engaging romp and action film. People get punched and stuff blows up. Escalation ensues.
* I also watched [The Covenant](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Guy%5FRitchie%27s%5FThe%5FCovenant). It&#39;s mostly just a good military action movie, and beats you over the head with the theme &quot;don&#39;t abandon your coworkers.&quot;

Listen

* [Why Nintendo sued a game emulator out of existence â€” and what might happen next](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;4&#x2F;4&#x2F;24121448&#x2F;why-nintendo-sued-a-game-emulator-out-of-existence-and-what-might-happen-next) was an interesting deep dive on video game emulation and how it&#39;s affected by law.
* [Japan&#39;s Lost Decade](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2024&#x2F;04&#x2F;03&#x2F;1197958583&#x2F;japan-lost-decade) by Planet Money was an interesting history of the economy of Japan in the last thirty years.

Read

* I enjoyed GQ&#39;s profile on [Trent Reznor &amp; Atticus Ross](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gq-magazine.co.uk&#x2F;article&#x2F;trent-reznor-atticus-ross-interview-2024).

Play

* I discovered [Convert Wiki Tables to CSV](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wikitable2csv.ggor.de&#x2F;). I&#39;ve wanted a tool like this forever. Saved me a bunch of time this week.
* I moved my Plex server to a new machine with higher processing power, which worked really well. Over the next week I&#39;ll be moving this website and other websites I run to the old machine! Lower cloud costs here I come.

I hope you have a great week!
