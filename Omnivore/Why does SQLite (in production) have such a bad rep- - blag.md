Why?

* Most people see it from a web workload perspective. Typically, we use Client-Server databases like PostgreSQL. But, SQLite absolutely shines in many other cases like mobile or embedded devices.
* For a long time, SQLite did not allow concurrent writes along with readers. This was changed in the WAL mode, where you could have a writer with multiple readers.
* You still cannot have multiple concurrent writers. That immediately puts off people. Your workload might or might not need this.
* SQLite did not have a good backup and replication story. This was a major issue, but [Ben Johnson](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;benbjohnson) changed the entire scene with [Litestream](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;litestream.io&#x2F;). I would say this was one of the most impactful contributions to SQLite ecosystem.
* Some ORMs &#x2F; libraries come with terrible defaults. For example, not setting &#x60;PRAGMA busy_timeout&#x60;.
* Funny little story: I started learning programming with Django, and the docs straight up said SQLite isnâ€™t suitable for production. I had a wrong impression for a long time. Then I started using it for my own use cases and realized the trade-offs.

SQLite, like any other database, has its pros and cons. For the majority of applications and scales, it is perfect. You always have PostgreSQL for anything else.

TLDR: SQLite slaps. You will be fine.
