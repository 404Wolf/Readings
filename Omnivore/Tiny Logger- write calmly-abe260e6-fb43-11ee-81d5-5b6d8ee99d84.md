### [SPQR and unlocking new spaces](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tinylogger.com&#x2F;max&#x2F;fjqD3uQUjZlnLrbe)

Still round the corner there may wait A new road or a secret gate And though I oft have passed them by A day will come at last when I Shall take the hidden paths that run West of the Moon, East of the Sun \~ [Bilbo&#39;s Walking Song](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tolkiengateway.net&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;A%5FWalking%5FSong)

When I was very young, back in the goodest, oldest days, I liked to watch my dad play video games on our fancy new computer. My dad was, and is, a huge Roman History buff, and one of the earliest games I remember him playing was [SQPR: The Empire&#39;s Darkest Hour](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SPQR:%5FThe%5FEmpire%27s%5FDarkest%5FHour). The premise of this 1996 game is that you&#39;re an Ancient Roman inventor trying to unravel a sinister plot to destroy Rome. You [point-and-click through the game](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;j81j26sKsp0&amp;t&#x3D;443s) visiting glorious 3D temples, bathhouses, homes, and inns, completing quests, picking up clues and objects, and reading countless long scrolls filled with local happenings and important information on the five primary suspects. Your job is to identify the villain, known simply as &quot;Calamitus.&quot; (Must be a tough name to apply for a mortgage with...)[Reviews](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gamespot.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;spqr-the-empires-darkest-hour-review&#x2F;1900-2533146&#x2F;) praised SPQR for its graphics and music, and criticized the overly complex interface and absolutely overwhelming amount of information. Playing it properly would&#39;ve involved reading and absorbing countless scrolls. And because the vast map of Rome contained dozens of buildings with hundreds of rooms and passageways, you couldn&#39;t hope to simply luck your way into the right next step. So, we didn&#39;t play the game properly. As a seven-year-old, I wasn&#39;t very helpful in keeping track of all the biographical info on our suspects, so my dad and I read the [walkthrough](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cheatbook.de&#x2F;wfiles&#x2F;spqrtm.htm) guide, and I&#39;d occasionally tell him what to do next. Just following clear instructions was hard enough! (The last time I replayed the game, in college, it took me about 3.5 hours to finish it.) But, I loved being immersed in the world of ancient Rome, feeling a sense of progress as we checked off task after task, manually advancing in time using the game&#39;s convoluted interface, being able to enter new buildings as we progressed. And that particular experience really stuck with me. From the beginning, you can access most of the map, and can knock on a lot of closed doors. As you progress through the game, you&#39;re able to enter each building one by one, exploring its mysteries and challenges. This isn&#39;t a revolutionary concept in open-world games; in essence, each building is a mini-level, and you can see each level&#39;s tantalizing entrance and shape from the beginning. But I can&#39;t describe how curious I was about what was in each building, and the satisfaction of finally entering, say, the Temple of Saturn three hours into the game, when my dad and I walked past it (or knocked on the door) hundreds of times. I often think about this mechanic in everyday life. The allegory is most obvious with physical spaces, but it also applies to events and people. Some spaces aren&#39;t ready for us yet, and we have to find the right tools, or do things in sequence, or solve a puzzle, to get in. Many wondrous mini-levels await.
