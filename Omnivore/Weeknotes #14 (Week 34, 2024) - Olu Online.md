* been thinking a lot about [the ephemerality of things](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;smbc-comics.com&#x2F;comic&#x2F;2009-06-10), isn&#39;t it. There&#39;s a line in a clipping song that I keep whispering to myself — partly earworm, partly echolalia, partly because I find it funny — [&quot;death is coming for you but you already knew that&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;fIrpLBShe1A?si&#x3D;1jxGCv19KjSVqHNO&amp;t&#x3D;175). [momento mori](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Memento%5Fmori) has never been so catchy!
* got a new mic and have really enjoyed playing around with it so far. it&#39;s a rode nt-usb mini! I got the fancy boom arm that comes with it too as I know I can&#39;t be trusted to hold a mic close enough to my face, or not to just leave it uselessly far away on the desk. i think my set up is now (... or perhaps has been for a while) excessive for someone who has released as few videos as I have, but hopefully I&#39;ll be rectifying that soon.
* trying very hard not to set any new challenges for myself, but (everyone heaving a collective sigh, I&#39;m sure) I do want to be more focused on my research questions in tech (mostly frontend questions like getting really good at CSS, but also computer science fundamentals and permacomputing and &quot;digitally-enabled flourishing&quot; type stuff). Does anyone know of any communities for independent research that aren&#39;t focused on any one particular topic? I&#39;ve always enjoyed the cross-pollination you get when you have interested people of different disciplines in a room, online and off. Perhaps it works less well than I think if there&#39;s not an overarching focus?
* i&#39;m also struggling with time management, in that i feel like i don&#39;t want to manage it but i do want to know what i&#39;ve done with it! I&#39;ve tried doing formal time audits, where you track every fifteen - thirty minutes of what with what you&#39;ve done, but i struggle with that even for a week as i forget i&#39;m meant to be doing it. i&#39;ve tried many apps; the closest to being good for me was [daily](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dailytimetracking.com&#x2F;) but it turns out it doesn&#39;t have an android app, and even i am not on my computer literally all day so it doesn&#39;t work for me. I&#39;m trying to take a less granular approach in capacities, day logging in a bullet journal flavoured way, but most of my entries for last week are blank so not a winner either. I guess i should think more about WHY i want to track my time, and i think intentionality is the reason. i want to know i am trying to do things i like or care about with my time. should probably build something, i have been thinking about this for years.
* can&#39;t remember and not going to check if i talked about this last week, but i&#39;ve been thinking a lot about community as a prerequisite for lasting change. it&#39;s very difficult (if not outright impossible) to make a huge, permanent shift in any area without having a group of people that agree with you or gave you the power to change it. i struggle a lot with this as i feel like — possibly obviously from the above about time tracking — that individuals should be able to create these changes on some level, and i act like i believe it explicitly more than i&#39;d like. i guess some people would then shift their attention towards trying to [win friends and influence people](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;How%5Fto%5FWin%5FFriends%5Fand%5FInfluence%5FPeople) but it&#39;s just not in my wheelhouse, i have to actually like people sadly.
