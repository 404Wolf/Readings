* shocked and astounded we have one week left of June and of Q2, like I am every year. weirdly excited for the planning i&#39;ll get to do this week, and once again accepting and being joyful about the fact that planning is definitely a leisure activity and&#x2F;or self-care for me.
* enjoying the way i&#39;ve been planning as well: doing quarterly plans, instead of trying to load up all my aspirations at the start of the year. there have been so many mid-month&#x2F;week&#x2F;day adjustments anyway, may as well go along with it.
* been inspired by all the planning youtubers i watch to set a more airy-fairy &quot;intention&quot; for the week as well as goals, and whilst you sadly won&#39;t get my intention for this or most other weeks, you can have my question of the week: &quot;why am i doing this?&quot;
* been working on a video + blog post about the digital divide, who isn&#39;t online, and why the internet is a human right (but one we shouldn&#39;t be forced to take up), and surprise surprise it&#39;s spiralling a bit out of control? I don&#39;t know how you decide if I&#39;m accepting and commiting to a 2 hour video OR that I&#39;m cutting it down into little packages and making a series. Any opinions, pointers or questions are [always welcome](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;contact).
* got sick on friday — mild cold, supposedly not COVID according to tests — so less to say than usual but didn&#39;t want to break my habit!
