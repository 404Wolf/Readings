[  Olu Online ](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;) 

[blog](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;blog) [about](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;about) [projects](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;projects) [contact me](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;contact) [tip me?](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;coffee) [now](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;now) [notes](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.olu.online&#x2F;)

* incredibly illegal friday weeknotes. i&#39;m on a most wanted list for bloggers now i&#39;m sure.
* really enjoying [web curios](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webcurios.co.uk&#x2F;) for, would you believe it, curios on the web, like [crowdwave](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crowdwave.com&#x2F;). love the idea of this site a lot even if i high-key assume i am unintelligible without captions (and the site would be better with captions anyway!), i know some people will love it.
* researching for [my talk next week in Bristol](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webdevconf.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;2024&#x2F;) and realising the [&quot;wood wide web&quot; isn&#39;t as cool as previously anticipated](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;undark.org&#x2F;2023&#x2F;05&#x2F;25&#x2F;where-the-wood-wide-web-narrative-went-wrong&#x2F;) made me sad but also is interesting. i learnt other cool things about soil and trees, for example did you know [1 teaspoon of soil](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ceh.ac.uk&#x2F;why-do-soil-microbes-matter#:~:text&#x3D;Microbes%20are%20central%20to%20all,and%20around%2010%2C000%20different%20species.) has about a billion microbes in it?
* i definitely needed to refill my wonder cup. wonder as in awe. i make a practice of cultivating it as part of secular technopagan stuff, but i have fallen off all my practices hard recently. i like a quote i heard recently [&quot;all models are wrong, but some are useful&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;All%5Fmodels%5Fare%5Fwrong#:~:text&#x3D;All%20models%20are%20wrong%2C%20but%20some%20are%20useful%22).
* i want to get better at reading tarot for this reason but i keep forgetting i intend to do this until i randomly see my cards in my room on my desk and that&#39;s always in the middle of something else. habits are hard!
* i&#39;m getting up earlier for work these days and it&#39;s nice having mornings, though weirdly i&#39;m finding it harder to sleep at night? thank you body for your contribution.
* i keep wanting to write about online dating - not really here, more as a writing thing - but i feel like it&#39;s overdone. then again, i haven&#39;t seen much software criticism of dating apps (or software criticism in general besides [wired](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;software-criticism&#x2F;) so maybe i should get over myself and make it anyway.
