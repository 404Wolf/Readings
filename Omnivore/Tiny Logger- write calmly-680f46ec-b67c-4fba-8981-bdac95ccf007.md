### [The $10 quiche](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tinylogger.com&#x2F;max&#x2F;m23fIacnsYBu2j8Q)

Waiting on line to get coffee at one of my favorite [local spots](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tinylogger.com&#x2F;max&#x2F;RCtgO270DxE9CJyF), I noticed veggie mini-quiches in the pastry case. When the barista rang me up, I was shocked that it cost $10! That seemed excessive for a pastry, which I&#39;d expect to be $4-6 tops. Reading the surprise on my face, the barista explained that she baked the quiche by hand, and that each quiche had two eggs, and that the price was meant to be analogous to a sandwich. I tried the quiche, and it was _phenomenally good_. Maybe the best quiche I&#39;ve ever had. I wasn&#39;t trying to talk myself into liking it in a sad example of the [sunk cost](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sunk%5Fcost) fallacy. In fact, I was ready to huff and puff about getting ripped off. And it just took one bite to change my mind. Moreover, the barista was right: the quiche really was a lot more filling than a typical pastry - like a breakfast sandwich would&#39;ve been. And I&#39;d be fine paying $10 for a breakfast sandwich. Once I pendulum swung from being amazed by the pricy quiche to loving it, I learned the twist to this saga: she only bakes the quiches once a week, and they sell out fast. Now, I&#39;m simultaneously frustrated by how expensive the quiches are, and annoyed I can&#39;t have them more often.![&quot;shut up and take my money&quot; meme](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app&#x2F;0x0,sKAoByzTal2Nxng-EwgF7dnt0yXu7hF-wuTT51-gCVdc&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.kym-cdn.com&#x2F;entries&#x2F;icons&#x2F;original&#x2F;000&#x2F;005&#x2F;574&#x2F;takemymoney.jpg)I&#39;ve now had the quiche a few times, and it&#39;s amazing every time (it doesn&#39;t hurt that it&#39;s often the first thing I eat that morning). I&#39;m not sure what the lesson here is: maybe it&#39;s to focus on making a top-notch product, and the price will work itself out, or to not be afraid to charge what you&#39;re worth, regardless of the customer&#39;s first reaction, or that sometimes high prices are justified, or that scarcity is good for business. Whatever it is, I went from being shocked by a $10 price to throwing my wallet at the cashier I see it in the pastry case. Also, I&#39;m gonna try to bake a quiche at home. If you&#39;re interested, I&#39;ll be selling slices for $9.
