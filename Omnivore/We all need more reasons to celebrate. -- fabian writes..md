Every now and again, figuring out how old you are in days [becomes a minor internet moment](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;CasualConversation&#x2F;comments&#x2F;llk2ta&#x2F;i%5Fam%5F9999%5Fdays%5Fold%5Ftoday&#x2F;). It’s an interesting idea: age is a _useful_ concept, but it’s measured arbitrarily. We measure it in fractional orbits around the sun, but we could just as meaningfully choose:

* the number of times the earth has rotated on its axis (days), or
* the number of times the moon has orbited the earth (\~lunar months), or
* the height of a specific tree in the middle of the town that you live in, or
* the aggregate distance that your body has traveled relative to the center of the galaxy, like we’re all interplanetary used cars, slowly putting astronomical units on the odometer.

We don’t tend to count the days, except when we’re looking forward to something – a wedding, the weekend, a deadline. But maybe we should? Birthdays are arbitrary, there is not enough joy in the world, and we all need more reasons to celebrate.

Go ahead and make a minor celebration for a friend who doesn’t like to celebrate themselves. Bring them a donut or send them a text and tell them that you’re glad that they were born 13,000 days ago. There’s something wonderful about completely unexpected, low-pressure celebrations.
