I don’t know if this will help anyone, but my doctor lets me do a prep where you mix Miralax with Gatorade and drink batches of that every 30 minutes or so. He told me more people will actually follow this prep, so he tends to prescribe it when possible.

My daughter had me try a cherry electrolyte drink that turned out to taste just like the prep drink I was given. I almost threw up.

(if you&#39;ve had problems with prep, anesthesia, electrolytes, etc. in the past, it&#39;s worth asking your doc if a different kind of test--for example, cologuard&#39;s DNA test--could be a replacement.)

I just did this last month. I put my Miralax in iced tea. It was ok to get down, but the aftertaste was disgusting. That much Miralax in liquid can definitely be tasted.

I’ve never understood the aversion to colonoscopies. Taking a bunch of drugs and doing butt stuff with a couple of rich doctors sounds like a party to _me_.

Frozen jello was a nice snack after prep since you can&#39;t eat much (only certain colors allowed).  
 I have suggested to the staff that wearing rubber alien masks might add to the experience.

Thanks to becoming lactose intolerant in my 40s, I had gotten quite used to shitting my guts empty by the time I was due for a colonoscopy, and really didn&#39;t find the prep all that awful. I also did not really have any disorientation from the sedative afterward. When my turn comes around again soon, I will probably try the poop-in-a-box thing, since there was nothing of concern from the first one. I figure I lived through several years of changing diapers and several decades of scooping litter boxes, so I&#39;m not really all that squeamish about touching my own poop.

I had a colonoscopy something like 8 years ago. I did not find the prep to be that bad. Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t clean on the inside, so I had to do it again, so less suck, but for twice as long. I was out for the procedure, and didn&#39;t have any side effects from the anesthesia, so it wasn&#39;t so bad.

I am terrified, not of the prep, not even of the test, but of the anesthesia. I had a hard time explaining this to my doc. The idea of being just anesthetized enough so that I might be talking, without a firm conscious grasp on what I am saying, is so mortifying, I don&#39;t even know what to do with the thought. And I&#39;ve read a million cheerful stories of people saying nonsense and having the nurses laugh and everyone gets on with life, but _what if I say something so horrible it changes my life forever_? And maybe that&#39;s an irrational fear but I absolutely don&#39;t know how to deal with it.

And I tried to make clear that I know the prep is really difficult for some people (and I&#39;m sorry that sucks so bad), but just to point out the difficulty with prep is a risk, not something that definitely happens to everybody.

I think maybe, for some people, they need to give you the drugs so you can get the prep down (I feel like a little fentanyl and ativan would make that terrible experience a lot more bearable) rather than for the procedure itself. I suppose it would be tough for people to care enough to keep swallowing the prep if they were on ativan and fentanyl though.

I have my very first colonoscopy this Monday and will do the prep on Sunday. Sounds like unpleasant times ahead but at least I know what I&#39;m in for. That being said, I know two people my age (mid 40s) who had colon cancer, one who died from it and another who was diagnosed during a colonoscopy and is currently undergoing treatment, so I value the fact that it&#39;s available as a screening tool.

One thing about colonoscopies is it is probably one of the few times where you will have people (nurses in this case) happy to hear that you are passing gas.

So I&#39;ve been doing the mail in stool samples for years, and they finally got a positive for blood in my stool So, last year I went in for my first (and t turns out second ) colonoscopy . They gave me the gavilax, and some pills, and told me to buy miralax, apparently, they weren&#39;t shitting around. I took and hated the gavilax, and the miralax, and forgot the pills. The pills turned out to be the important part so I had to come back the next day and continue with the gavilax and miralax. When I got home that first day I remembered the pills (well capsules, I think) and took them, so the second went fine. However, I really hate the gravlax and will never do that again. Since the ADHD meds I&#39;m on makes me constipated, I do the miralax every few days, and it&#39;s totally doable with water. Also, it turned out I was ok, I had just started on the ADHD meds, and , erm, injured myself, you know, down there. I won&#39;t need another colonoscopy or seven years. Also, as others keep saying, remember, this is my experience so ymmv.

If you&#39;re having trouble drinking the prep liquid because it tastes gross, colonoscopy prep is available in tablet form. I used something called Sutab. It&#39;s a bunch of tablets that you take with a large amount of water. You still have to drink a ton of water, so it doesn&#39;t help that much if the problem is just the sheer volume of liquid you need to consume. But it doesn&#39;t taste nasty, if that&#39;s your main problem.

Had it done 2 years ago. It was so easy, I find it hard to believe that people even talk about it. The worst part was not being able to eat the day before. I got hungry. But other than that? Zero annoyances. Well, aside from having to go to&#x2F;from a hospital and the time it takes up.

I had my first colonoscopy a couple of years ago, and I followed the prep instructions TO THE LETTER, and then I vomited halfway through the procedure while I was sedated. When I woke up and didn&#39;t know why my throat hurt (that would be because they had to vacuum out the vomit while I was asleep), they were like, &quot;Well, you didn&#39;t follow the instructions, did you? Had a little breakfast, right?&quot; And I couldn&#39;t convince them that I had done everything just like they said, but at the end one guy said &quot;Well maybe you have a slow stomach&quot;, like that&#39;s a thing. Turns out it&#39;s TOTALLY a thing, a thing that comes along with the diabetes I was diagnosed with the following year. God only knows what&#39;s going to happen the next time I have to do one, or have any kind of surgery or anything that requires an empty stomach.

Try to maintain enough presence of mind to sneak a phone in to the procedure so you can get a picture of your innards. For some Zoom meetings, it&#39;s the perfect camera background.

At the risk of being morbid, I recently lost a close relative to what turned out to be undiagnosed stage 4 colon cancer, partly because they avoided getting a colonoscopy well into their 60s. I&#39;m so glad to see colonoscopies discussed so openly here, and I hope it encourages at least one person to get one.   
Meanwhile, I&#39;m now going to have to get these a whole lot more frequently than before, so the tips here are appreciated, even though I&#39;m one of the weirdoes who kind of enjoys the prep.

I have 5 (or 6) feet of colon in me?! What am I, some kind of _House of Leaves_?

Huh. I&#39;m going to ask about an unsedated colonoscopy. I hadn&#39;t even thought about doing that, and most of my anxieties about getting a colonoscopy have to do with the sedation, not the prep or the procedure.

Late to this party, but you&#39;ll forgive as I am 2 months into a 6 month course of chemo for stage 3 rectal cancer discovered at a coloscopy last year.  
I&#39;m a gatorade and miralax prepper, never use any anesthetic because it&#39;s less uncomfortable to just have it and drive home than to recover and need a driver. Downside is that i got a good look at my nasty polyp that required a separate surgery and then turned out cancerous and required yet another surgery to remove part of my bowel. Good thing is they are pretty sure that they got everything, and the chemo is just to guard against metastatic disease, but...chemo ain&#39;t no pick-a-nick.  
Best I can say is there are worse things than a night on the toilet prepping.
