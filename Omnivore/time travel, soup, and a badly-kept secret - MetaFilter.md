&quot;Since when did Angelique Lancaster even look at this table, much less schlep over and sit at it?&quot; [A wish-fulfillment story fragment](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pitviperofdoom.tumblr.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;748756525714194432&#x2F;writing-prompt-s-a-loving-married-couple-wake-up), inspired by the prompt &quot;A loving, married couple wake up one day to find that they have returned to their high school days, when they were the most popular student and the class geek.&quot; Do mind the content notes at the start.

Telling it from a third character&#39;s perspective is a fantastic choice. I&#39;m often cynical of this style of writing prompt for being more about the prompt than the resulting story but adding a twist like that really redeems it. Actually, typing that makes me wonder if a sort of mix-and-match approach to writing prompts, with one being &quot;topical&quot; like the prompt in the link and one being &quot;mechanical&quot; like the perspective change, might be a useful combination.

That was so lovely! I want to watch this series on Netflix! Like I imagine scenes cut between the first round and this version.
