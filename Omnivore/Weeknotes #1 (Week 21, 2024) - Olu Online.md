* I haven&#39;t done weeknotes (or blogging of any kind tbh) in a while so enjoying being back, even as I vigorously sort the wheat from the chaff of my week. What can I even talk about? Lots of &quot;who gave me this microphone?&quot; type feelings popping up but I&#39;m rolling with it.
* My [&#x2F;now](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;now) page is up! Go there if you want to know what I&#39;m up to but don&#39;t want to reach out and strike up a conversation, god forbid.
* Doing Substack and YouTube again because I want more online community and joining other people&#39;s only seems to go so far. Please reach out and tell me about all the great communities I&#39;m missing of course, but this is my current plan anyway.
* Writing video essays is hard; I knew this on one level and not on another. Feeling a lot of resistance to writing my current script but hoping getting all the rest of the writing chugging along will help a lot.
* Journaling more; I was doing morning pages but this week morning&#39;s have been hard as hell. Been going for 22 days I think, which hasn&#39;t felt stressful surprisingly, I think my longest [750 words](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;new.750words.com&#x2F;) streak is about a month, so hoping to go for longer this time!
* Not reading as much as I&#39;d like in the &quot;longform and not on a website&#x2F;newsletter&quot; category, but I&#39;m examining not just doing things fro their intrinsic virtue anyway. Like am I doing something cos I enjoy it? Cos it serves me in some way? Or just because it distracts me from the pull of the grave&#x2F;TikTok doomscrolling for hours?
* Enjoying singing and music more too; I&#39;ve signed up for a songwriting course I&#39;m really looking forward to.
* Oh, and learning more computer science stuff; equal parts awed, interested and intimidated.
