### [Good enough!](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tinylogger.com&#x2F;max&#x2F;JrAYa9x1RhsIfzW9)

This post is going to contain some major spoilers for Michael Crichton&#39;s [_Prey_](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Prey%5F%28novel%29). Although I&#39;m focusing on structure and not giving away whodunit, if you&#39;re considering reading the book, do that instead! Unlike this post, the book has nanobots.

Crichton wrote _Prey_ around 2003, late in his career; he already achieved massive successes with Jurassic Park, Sphere, and Andromeda Strain. I recently finished _Prey_ and enjoyed it a lot, but it struck me that the book feels rough around the edges, like a good second draft. My issue isn&#39;t with the plot, characters, or world-building; it&#39;s with the structure. The pacing feels uneven and the ending feels frenetic, as though Crichton got tired of writing, or the book was rushed to publication. Early in the book, we&#39;re introduced to the the brilliant, sluggish soccer dad protagonist named Jack, and we learn a rich family backstory, complete with entertaining side characters. We get a bunch of emotional exposition and creepy foreshadowing. In classic Crichton style, the author educates us on the relevant science by fluidly working it into character dialogue and train-of-thought. At one point, Jack daydreams about the behavior of self-organizing programs, when another character snaps him back to reality, asking where his mind went. Smooth! Unfortunately, all this character development takes a backseat halfway through the book once the sexy sci-fi plot picks up. From that point on, Crichton focuses almost entirely on unraveling the mystery and dumping a ton more science on us, no longer bothering to cover it up in believable character interactions. The first half of the book is about a dad trying to raise his kids, keep his marriage alive, grow his career, and figure out why the electronics in his house keep failing. The second half is about **\[spoiler alert!\]** outsmarting an evolving swarm of nanobots. People die, relationships disintegrate, the kids are bickering, whatever. There&#39;s science to do! The first half of the book sets up some neat oddities, little treats for the reader to unwrap and figure out. Some of these are beautifully recalled in the second half, in service of the plot. But many others loose ends are resolved hastily, or punted _en masse_ to the post-climax epilogue. And, oh, the perplexing, rushed epilogue. Weeks after the story climax, Jack recounts what happened, and muses about all the unresolved threads. It feels like Crichton is writing straight from his notes.

Gandalf looked curiously at Frodo.

&quot;You know, Frodo&quot;, said the wizard, &quot;the eagles care little for the deeds of Men. They would not have come on command&quot;.

Frodo nodded. He was wondering how Gandalf came back from his mortal battle with the Balrog.

&quot;The deity Il√∫vatar sent me back to serve the world and the plot&quot;, added Gandalf.

Whatever the reason for the roller-coaster pacing, I believe Crichton knew the book wasn&#39;t finished. He had written too much good work, and parts of the book are notably better than others, for this to stem from lack of ability.

I love it. Not only is _Prey_ already a great read in its current state, I love that we get to see imperfect work from a great artist. When I was young, &quot;great art&quot; seemed complete, willed into perfect existence by some genius. Now that I can see the cracks, they only serve to humanize the author and make the work feel more attainable. _Prey_ was good enough to publish, and though the [reviews are mixed](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;83763.Prey#CommunityReviews), I was engrossed in it, and it&#39;s [done pretty well](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20210214004815&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2002&#x2F;11&#x2F;24&#x2F;books&#x2F;it-s-the-little-things.html) out in the world! Sometimes good enough is enough! Crichton was a phenomenal writer, and _Prey_ shines with its interesting characters, nerve-wracking plot, and clever, humorous dialogue. The world would be a more boring place if Crichton sat on the draft forever. If great writers can publish imperfect work, so can we. Some smarmy blogger might criticize it one day, but what&#39;s there is probably good enough to entertain and delight lots of people. And, you can always spend more time polishing your next book.
