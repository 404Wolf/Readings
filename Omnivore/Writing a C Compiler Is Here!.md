![My dog sitting on the couch next to a stack of copies of Writing a C Compiler, which he is looking at skeptically.](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app&#x2F;0x0,so9eNWCWXoPCyli4ms4Cwibvbx0qd6FsCXJTEKHhd3Zs&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;norasandler.com&#x2F;assets&#x2F;arlo_with_book.jpeg)

It’s finally here! _Writing a C Compiler_ goes on sale today on [Bookshop.org](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bookshop.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;books&#x2F;writing-a-c-compiler-build-a-real-programming-language-from-scratch-nora-sandler&#x2F;18414210), [Barnes &amp; Noble](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.barnesandnoble.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;writing-a-c-compiler-nora-sandler&#x2F;1141287012), [Amazon](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Writing-Compiler-Programming-Language-Scratch&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1718500424&#x2F;), and wherever books are sold[1](#fn1). (It’s been available [directly from No Starch Press](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nostarch.com&#x2F;writing-c-compiler) for a few weeks now!) You can find links to the companion code, errata, and other resources on the book’s [web page](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;norasandler.com&#x2F;book).

I’m incredibly grateful to everyone who preordered a copy, and especially to the readers who took the time to email me and share their feedback. One of the best parts of writing a project-based book like this hearing how people are making it their own—readers have been writing compilers in everything from Rust to Scheme to C, and a few brave souls are even targeting totally different instruction sets. I can’t wait to see what else this book’s readers build.
