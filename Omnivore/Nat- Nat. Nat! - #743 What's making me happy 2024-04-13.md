I&#39;m on a roll with these [#happy](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writing.natwelch.com&#x2F;tag&#x2F;happy) posts.

Listen

* [How climate change and physics affect baseball](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2024&#x2F;04&#x2F;08&#x2F;1198909646&#x2F;baseball-mlb-physics-climate-change-home-runs-pitches) makes a ton of sense, but I had never thought about it before.
* [Why the ambient music market is booming](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2024&#x2F;04&#x2F;07&#x2F;1243320753&#x2F;why-the-ambient-music-market-is-booming) doesn&#39;t actually answer the question, but it adds a lot of context. I personally listen (and attempt to create) a bunch of music in this genre, so it&#39;s exciting to see it grow.
* [First Light Radio - Volume 3](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mixcloud.com&#x2F;manbartlett&#x2F;first-light-radio-volume-3&#x2F;) by a former coworker of mine, [Man Bartlett](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;manbartlett.com&#x2F;), is a great mix of music of Jazz and other genres. Really does a great job at setting you up for a good day.

Watch

* [Stefan Janoski: From Underground Hero to Skate Icon | Epicly Later&#39;d](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;0cjli%5FoQC-s) and [Zach Harris | Longform Podcast #574](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;longform.org&#x2F;posts&#x2F;longform-podcast-574-zach-harris) are two pieces that are connected in a weird way. Stefan Janoski is a skateboarder who has a shoe with Nike, and Zach Harris is a journalist who has written about a bunch of topics including skateboarding. My takeaway from both was that hanging out with people can lead to good things. Probably not what they wanted you to take away from the pieces, but here we are.

Read

* [Going in circles without a real-time clock](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rachelbythebay.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;2024&#x2F;04&#x2F;10&#x2F;rtc&#x2F;) was fascinating story about a raspberryPi time failure.

Play

* I recently uploaded a video of myself [practicing eurorack playing](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;oJ9ZuzxhDq0?si&#x3D;lb3aEH0gMM6XwRij). This is generally terrible, but something I really struggle with is only seeing music presented as the final version. We don&#39;t see enough of musicians practicing or just generally being shitty, which makes it intimidating for people such as myself to start. So I&#39;m trying to change that. This particular video stopped with me being interrupted by dinner time, but I&#39;m going to try to do more of these.
