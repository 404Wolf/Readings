Reposting the [announcement posted on Lobsters](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lobste.rs&#x2F;s&#x2F;zzprkr&#x2F;weekly%5Flobsters%5Foffice%5Fhours) for my blog’s rss feed:

&gt; Hey folks,
&gt; 
&gt; When this post is two hours old, and indefinitely twice a week, I’m going to stream Lobsters office hours and development on Twitch. The [channel is here](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitch.tv&#x2F;pushcx) and more info + an archive is [on my blog](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;push.cx&#x2F;stream). (You don’t have to sign up to Twitch to watch.)
&gt; 
&gt; The office hours are largely to support iteratively running [queries](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lobste.rs&#x2F;about#queries). People don’t take me up on this very often except via IRC because it’s hard to write these things perfectly out of the gate. Having a fast feedback loop is essential. Also, maybe having an open office hours session will be a nicely informal opportunity to answer questions and generally demystify the site.
&gt; 
&gt; If nobody has questions I’ll hack on the Lobsters codebase. Hopefully this encourages more activity on the [repo](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lobsters&#x2F;lobsters). I’m also open to support people using the code to start a sister site, which is another activity that benefits from a tight feedback loop. ([example](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lobsters&#x2F;lobsters&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1265))
&gt; 
&gt; I plan to stream weekly on (US Central) Monday afternoons at 2 PM and Thursday mornings at 9 AM in the hopes that this gives reasonable timezone coverage. Sorry for the inconvenience if you are antipodal to Chicago, though the site has [always run on Chicago time](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lobsters&#x2F;lobsters&#x2F;blob&#x2F;f2d7f4a8465ddf9141057c293ac4bb6d253143f3&#x2F;config&#x2F;application.rb#L40). Sessions will probably run 1.5 to 3 hours and I’ll put summaries and transcripts in [my archive](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;push.cx&#x2F;stream) for easy searching. I’ll try to keep the [twitch schedule](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twitch.tv&#x2F;pushcx&#x2F;schedule) up-to-date and I already know I’ll miss 9&#x2F;1 for a vacation.
&gt; 
&gt; This is pretty experimental! I did it a few streams back in summer of 2020 that went well, but everything was pretty chaotic that year [for some reason](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;COVID-19%5Fpandemic) and I dropped it. I did a technical rehearsal this weekend that [went reasonably smoothly](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;push.cx&#x2F;stream&#x2F;2024-08-10-test-stream). If this continues to be interesting and useful, I’ll keep it up and try new things. Feedback here, in the stream chat, or by email (peter@ [my domain](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;push.cx&#x2F;)) is much appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Special guest host will be my cat (subject to his schedule and whim). See y’all in our weird parasocial future.
