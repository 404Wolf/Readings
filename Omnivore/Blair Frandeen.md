## The Perseverance of Identity

Last month I was laid off from the only job I’ve ever held, along with more than 500[1](#fn1) of some of the most talented people in the solar system. I’d served as a mechanical engineer at NASA’s [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jpl.nasa.gov&#x2F;) for more than a decade, and I was quickly making my way to being a full-time software systems engineer. I worked on a flying saucer, a satellite that measures the Earth’s water cycle, and a Mars rover. I was _thrilled_ about the work I did every day, and this unexpected loss has been devastating.

From Mars, with Optimism

JPL was characteristically open with us that layoffs were probably coming[2](#fn2), letting us know a month in advance that job losses were a distinct possibility. In hindsight, I wish they had just woken us up one morning and fired us without warning. The anxiety of knowing the axe may fall wore on me for weeks leading up to the event.

I ran into a friend at a birthday party two weeks before the layoffs were formally announced. He had it on good info that the layoff was coming the next week, or the week after. And I was just wracked with these waves of anxiety, full body waves of tension, off and on, until I was finally given notice.

Being on paternity leave with our infant son while this was happening, I tried to hide my head in the sand. I turned off my work communications that I had still been monitoring. I muted the group chat with my friends who may know something I didn’t. Turning off these distractions &amp; focusing on the present was helpful and made me a little more free, but it didn’t solve the intense anxiety I was feeling.

Years ago, my therapist introduced me to a cognitive behavioral writing exercise to help unpack and address fear and anxiety. I dug up those notes, and tried to work through the process:

* I identified my debilitating anxiety as the consequence that needed to be addressed.
* The activating event that led to this anxiety was hearing or thinking about myself and my friends possibly losing our jobs.
* I then looked at the belief that tied the activating event and consequence together, and attempted to reason my way into a stronger belief.

Clearly the belief I needed to work on was, “I am a good employee and valuable to the institution and not in the bottom quartile of performers,” right? I’m consistently a top performer in my organization, I consistently document what I’ve done and what my goals are, and I do great work[3](#fn3).

As it turns out, none of my stellar performance mattered. Not for me, and not for other colleagues who I looked up to as far superior to myself. And trying to convince myself of the security of my position wasn’t working.

So what could I have done? I certainly was never in control of my destiny, but we are always in control of how we perceive events, and how we react to them. What was the belief that was _really_ driving me down?

Once I found out I was cut, I realized that the belief in my identity was what made this so hard: I was a JPLer, a member of the Perseverance Rover’s operations team, and part of the Mars Sample Return mission. A mission that’s never been done before, and a mission that’s more complex than any single person can understand. I met some of my closest friends because we all started on the same day ten years before.

And the JPL part of my identity was unceremoniously ripped away: we were told to stay home, listen to our upper management read from a script, and wait for an email indicating our fate. Nobody was willing to look us in the eye and tell us we didn’t make the cut.

The Perseverance Rover with its operating team after 1000 sols on Mars, December 12th, 2023\. I started my paternity leave for my son hours after this photo was taken. Unbeknownst to me, this would be the last day I worked for JPL. I’m in the back left, somewhere: part of something bigger.

My identity isn’t totally gone: I’m a man, a husband, a father, an American, and an engineer. Recently I’ve put the job search on hold, while I bring myself to a more focused and purposeful place. Being a father of two is awesome, and I feel so blessed for all of this extra time with my family.

Careers are long, and I think the best ones are non-linear; mine has been. This layoff likely won’t be the last time that my path will be altered by circumstances beyond my control. But it can be the last time that it cuts so deeply to my core. I’ll get a different job. I will do great work and exceed expectations. And I can do so without my employer being so entangled in who I am.

1. Approximately an 8% staffing reduction.[↩︎](#fnref1)
2. The cause of the layoffs was an unfavorable [institutional review board report](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nasa.gov&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2023&#x2F;09&#x2F;msr-irb-report-final-copy-v3.pdf) on the Mars Sample Return mission, coupled with a United States congress that did not resolve the NASA budget until halfway through the fiscal year.[↩︎](#fnref2)
3. My clear goals &amp; documentation, coupled with stellar performance, led me to getting consistently above-average pay adjustments at the end of the fiscal year, likely making me more expensive and a bigger line-item to cross off.[↩︎](#fnref3)
