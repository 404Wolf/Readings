‚Ä¶but maybe I will! 

My tech writing these days follows DDD (Dopamine-Driven Development), which means that if you tell me what you want to read from me, I will be that much more likely to write it.

Without further ado, some things I could write _right now_[1](#footnote-1):

###  Project write-ups[2](#footnote-2) and tutorials

* _Musidex_ | What I wanted was a Craigslist jukebox; what I got was a Rolodex. (Closing line: _I still want a Craigslist jukebox._)
* _Obsessed with [Cuttle](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cuttle.xyz&#x2F;): Parametric CAD for prototyping, producing, and procrastinating_
* _Making mixtapes for your youngest pals_ | Do you want to enable the song addictions of the small children in your life, to set them on a path towards music obsession, while potentially annoying the heck out of their parents? Of course you do! (This post is not sponsored by [Yoto](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;us.yotoplay.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;library), but could be, should they choose‚Ä¶ üëÄ)
* _Small Tales_ | On building a bookshelf of your favorite reads, in miniature, for when you have limited bookshelf space or a limited book budget.
* _Mobiles! For that new tiny human in your extended universe_
* _Easy inter-room trolling: OSX‚Äôs &#x60;say&#x60;, a bluetooth speaker, and you_
* _Quick and easy meme-making, for fun and no profit_[3](#footnote-3)
* _How do I do a creative coding?_[3](#footnote-3)
* _Mix of the Month Clubs for the 2020s_ | Mixtapes are my love language, but no one has a cd player anymore (not to mention a disc drive, or a cassette player). What‚Äôs a fellow to do?
* _Message in a bottle, or, the US Postal Service is way more fun than most people know it is_
* _Stabby McStabface: The joy of needlefelting memes_
* _From LiveJournal to [tinylogger](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tinylogger.com&#x2F;) and beyond: My current writing workflow_
* _How should I know when there‚Äôs a new blog to read?_ | What the heck is RSS, and how do I make it work for me if I don‚Äôt consider myself tech saavy?
* _The rest of the owl: My first experience with [codecrafters](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codecrafters.io&#x2F;)_

###  Feelings‚Ñ¢ (tech and otherwise)

* _Dopamine-Driven Development (DDD), Spite-Driven Development (SDD), and other DDs_
* _A batch at the Recurse Center: My antidote to burnout_
* _The Mike Ratio: A Bechdel test for the modern tech team_
* _Towards a Bechdel test for assessing a candidate employer_[4](#footnote-4)
* _The Hannahspeak cheatsheet_ | The what&#x2F;why&#x2F;wherefore&#x2F;emojis of the phrases I parrot, and why you might want to use them too
* _The ‚Äújust‚Äù flag flies true_
* _The 1-1 IC template for my future self (that I wish I‚Äôd been using all along)_
* _Niceties‚Ñ¢: From third grade to the Recurse Center, and beyond_

Right. Now that I‚Äôve gotten this current list out of my head, maybe I‚Äôll be able to pick one and just go for it‚Ä¶.

###  Footnotes

[1](#footnote-1-site)Not included: any hypothetical projects I have not yet done.

[2](#footnote-2-site)Also, this list only includes a few of the as-yet-undocumented [projects](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hannahilea.com&#x2F;projects-site) from my backlog, but anything on that page is fair game for a DDD request.

[3](#footnote-3-site)These already exist in slide form from my batch at RC, so :just: need to be edited appropriately.

[4](#footnote-4-site)Why yes, the [Bechdel test](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bechdel%5Ftest) does play an oversized role in my consciousness, why do you ask? As does [Bechdel herself](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alison%5FBechdel) and [the musical incarnation of her memoir](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;-Qlagsg5LT8).
