Iâ€™m [Faisal](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;falqas&#x2F;), a Software Engineer based in New York City. Iâ€™m full stack, but am drawn to work that involves the backend and lots of data. I love building tools that make peopleâ€™s lives easier and less stressful. Iâ€™m also interested in both hardware hacking and language learning. Sometimes I write about what Iâ€™m learning, and other times, I learn about what Iâ€™m writing.
