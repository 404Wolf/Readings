A [#happy](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writing.natwelch.com&#x2F;tag&#x2F;happy) post on time ish! Whee.

TV &amp; Movies

* I watched the [Bahrain GP](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.formula1.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;racing&#x2F;2024&#x2F;Bahrain.html). It was fun, but not an amazing race. I wish I had watched [the Tottenham game](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;2obL4gtlHC0?si&#x3D;6eNJB2RuMmAq3dKr) instead.

Music

* Been listening to [Wall Of Eyes](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;open.spotify.com&#x2F;album&#x2F;6PdPOv5ybKZ9ZuGMk5iGZd?si&#x3D;PkHghlcASauHzZxkkJCqmQ) by The Smile. It&#39;s basically a Radiohead album without being by Radiohead.

Read

* Our bookclub is reading [How to murder your employer](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;61272658) and it has been a delight. Would recommend.
* I read [this post on the history of Go](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;pulse&#x2F;gos-early-growth-2012-2016-sameer-ajmani-oxtjc&#x2F;) by Sameer Ajmani. It was fun and I&#39;m looking forward to reading the rest of his posts.

Play

* I&#39;ve gotten hooked on [Slay the Spire](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Slay%5Fthe%5FSpire). It&#39;s a rogue like with a card collecting gameplay. It&#39;s a hoot. I&#39;m playing it on PS5, but it&#39;s on all of the systems.
