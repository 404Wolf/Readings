* i actually remembered to post this on a monday, what a turn up for the history books.
* passed my life in the uk test first time so operation british citizenship is full steam ahead! so excited.
* watched _i saw the tv glow_ at the cinema. i was not blown away but i was glad about that. _&quot;without courage all other virtues are meaningless&quot;_ indeed.![A frame from i saw the tv glow. owen is walking down a high school hallway. a poster on the wall reads &quot;without courage, all other virtues are meaningless&quot; and over the entire scene in pink are the words &quot;isabel and tara are like family to me&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app&#x2F;0x0,sFrSScSfBH2JSHd1AIyVuPNClCFgAVueAzXdkjgWM7qw&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com&#x2F;oluonline-1722284878.jpeg)
* cos of the [recurse center](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recurse.com&#x2F;) discussion boards i&#39;ve been thinking a lot about [rest](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ntietz.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;integrate-rest-into-your-work-and-practice&#x2F;?utm%5Fsource&#x3D;atom&amp;utm%5Fmedium&#x3D;feed), permacomputing and digital estate planning (as in &quot;what happens to my digital life and assets after i die?&quot;) again. no conclusions yet other than the latter two seem very hard and rest is very important (and it&#39;s hard to internalise that).
* been thinking a lot about [leveling up as a software developer](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;how-im-leveling-up-technically-as-a-self-taught-software-developer&#x2F;); i started going through [teach yourself cs](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;teachyourselfcs.com&#x2F;) and i needed more maths than anticipated to make progress in the stated order. i don&#39;t think I&#39;m incapable of learning the pre-requisite maths - i did well at GCSE and was very ill during ib so didn&#39;t give it the old college try lol - I just think I need more human guidance on how the hell to catch up when it&#39;s often notation and wording tripping me up. googling &quot;what&#39;s that weird s&quot; won&#39;t bring up an explanation I understand so it&#39;s a challenge lol. i&#39;ve started looking at a new platform called [0de5](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.0de5.net&#x2F;) and learning some c is on the agenda now, so we&#39;ll see how we go!
* really want some more technical mentorship with CSS and frontend architecture stuff but I should probably keep going with snapback (my habit app) and see what I can learn on my own for now. i feel like i can ask recurse some of the questions and I have [css for js devs](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;css-for-js.dev&#x2F;) to go through so should probably finish that before bothering people! I really enjoyed wizard zines [css zine](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wizardzines.com&#x2F;zines&#x2F;css&#x2F;) too (i love all their zines, not going to lie).
* gonna start posting more drafts over on [my notes site](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.olu.online&#x2F;), the latest one is on [the weird headlines about an &#39;uncontacted tribe&#39; getting Starlink](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.olu.online&#x2F;disconnected---the-Marubo-people-are-online); very much in draft state but I&#39;d love opinions!
