_The Atlantic_ published an article recently about how [young adults have the worst mental health of any age group in the US](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;family&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2024&#x2F;08&#x2F;young-adult-mental-health-crisis&#x2F;679601&#x2F;).[1](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;riskmusings.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;affordability-and-young-adults-mental#footnote-1-148664691) It’s [based on](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mcc.gse.harvard.edu&#x2F;reports&#x2F;on-edge) [a survey conducted by the Harvard Graduate School of Education’s Making Caring Common Project](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;static1.squarespace.com&#x2F;static&#x2F;5b7c56e255b02c683659fe43&#x2F;t&#x2F;6537db8894f0802b6480d38e&#x2F;1698159503140&#x2F;On+Edge%5FFINAL.pdf).[2](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;riskmusings.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;affordability-and-young-adults-mental#footnote-2-148664691) 

The study’s findings differ from my experiences as a young adult, when I felt relatively carefree and surrounded by friends. But so much _is_ different now. First and foremost: affordability.[3](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;riskmusings.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;affordability-and-young-adults-mental#footnote-3-148664691) The cost of any kind of reasonable lifestyle has skyrocketed. And it’s gaslighting—or, as I like to call it, avocado-toasting—not to acknowledge it.

So, here we go, a rough accounting[4](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;riskmusings.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;affordability-and-young-adults-mental#footnote-4-148664691) of my mid-twenties: as a young adult living in L.A., not quite three years after graduating from college, I made a little less than $45,000 and had: 

* My own “bachelor” apartment in Westwood ($775 per month) with free parking
* A used car (later upgraded to a new Honda Civic for about $15,000)
* Car insurance ($100 per month)
* A full tank of gas each week ($1-$2 per gallon)
* PPO health insurance through work (about $225 per month, I think?)
* A gym membership ($35 per month)
* A gourmet grocery shopping habit
* An active social life that included restaurant meals, movie nights, concerts, museums, tai chi classes, art classes, and dates.

Yes, that was a while ago, so $45,000 then equates to about $80,000 now. But the truth is: a similar lifestyle in a desirable major city, even on the higher inflation-adjusted salary, is essentially fiction for today’s twenty-somethings and even many thirty-somethings. 

A more likely configuration today involves two or three roommates, a struggle to afford health care if not on a parent’s plan[5](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;riskmusings.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;affordability-and-young-adults-mental#footnote-5-148664691), and a decrease in privacy and quality of life. It should be obvious that worrying about finances more and struggling to afford a plain-old regular life would lead to greater anxiety and depression. 

Although health insurance, out-of-pocket expenses, and car insurance all cost much more now, the _T. rex_ in the room is housing, and how unaffordable it has become for anyone working a regular job outside of finance and Big Tech. 

I feel like this point is not discussed often enough with concrete personal-finance snapshots from more affordable times—which is why I’ve provided my numbers as a concrete point of comparison to show just how insane prices have gotten, especially for housing. 

In my mid-twenties, I was working in journalism, not a high-paying profession back then and [probably even lower-paying now when adjusted for inflation](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oregoncapitalchronicle.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;07&#x2F;09&#x2F;journalism-has-become-ground-zero-for-the-vocation-crisis&#x2F;). I had a nice life—_and_ a creative one. It used to be possible to choose a relatively lower-paying job and still live independently and with enjoyment. 

I’m sure Boomers can tell even more affordable stories about _their_ early housing costs.

The lead researcher described in _The_ _Atlantic_’s article was “taken aback” by the study results showing young adults have the highest rates of depression and anxiety. But I am not at all surprised. It’s not young adults’ fault that many of them can’t afford a middle-class lifestyle. It’s objectively much harder to get started today, and living independently likely requires a six-figure salary in desirable locations. Stretched finances breed anxiety and curtail future options.

People need [opportunity and hope](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;riskmusings.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;opportunity-and-hope). Maybe we don’t just [fight inflation by building starter homes](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;riskmusings.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;to-fight-inflation-build-starter); maybe we _also_ fight hopelessness, stress, and mental illness by building housing—and by offering an understanding ear to young adults who are struggling in the meantime.

There are other contributing issues: perhaps social media, a shift to online rather than in-person interactions, a lack of opportunities to practice low-stakes independence before graduating from college. But affordability is a big one—and the study confirms this.

Figures are approximate but close enough to get the point across.

Though at least you _can_ get healthcare if you dare to have a pre-existing condition, which is a major improvement compared to back then.
