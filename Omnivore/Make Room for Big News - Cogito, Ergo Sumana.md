Make Room for Big News

* [Advice](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;harihareswara.net&#x2F;posts&#x2F;advice)

We live in interesting times.

A friend of mine was taking an online class yesterday, and big national news ([President Biden deciding not to pursue re-election](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;cpwd8yzw45qo)) interrupted that class. The news distracted everyone and shattered concentration.

Sometimes I lead workshops (usually via group videocall). So I thought: this sort of thing will likely happen, at some point, during a workshop I lead. How should I deal with it? How can I plan for it, so my participants can take care of themselves appropriately?

**A rough plan**

My first draft plan goes like this:

Big news might arrive as an unexpected interruption. I assume that, since I usually don&#39;t look at news or social media during a workshop, I might get a text message or a call about something big. More likely, a participant would learn it and bring it up, perhaps speaking up to interrupt me, maybe writing something in the text chat.

If it&#39;s an absolute crisis that needs immediate attention, especially if some participants (or I) will need to take action to protect ourselves, then the class may need to end early. Example: a natural disaster. I&#39;ll take a breath to compose myself, then immediately inform everyone of a summary of the news, and tell them I&#39;m going to stop the class and why. If possible, I&#39;ll send a quick email followup with any resources for self-study that participants can use in lieu of the workshop. Alternatively, if it&#39;s possible to keep the class going for the people who can stay, then I&#39;ll try to do that, but I&#39;ll plan to run a makeup session for the people who need to leave.

More often, news is likely to be something important but not immediately dangerous. Example: a major court verdict. So, again, I&#39;ll take a breath to center myself, and then inform participants of the news. I&#39;ll make time for an unscheduled break to give everyone a few minutes to read and process the news (if I don&#39;t do that, a bunch of participants will probably be distracted and unable to listen or work effectively anyway). And then, when they return, I&#39;ll say: _you know what you need in order to take care of yourself. If you are not going to be able to concentrate for the rest of the workshop because of this news, then please head off._ And then I&#39;ll try to mindfully manage the rest of the workshop, knowing that some people will find in it a welcome refuge from the news, and that some people will still be a little preoccupied.

I figure I&#39;ll iterate on this as I go, and as I learn what other facilitators do.

**Leadership**

I&#39;m also reminded of [something Heidi Waterhouse wrote](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;heidiwaterhouse.com&#x2F;extremely-online-people&#x2F;), speaking to marketing folks who often write and pre-schedule social media posts and similar promotional material for later publication:

&gt; We need a kill switch for all scheduled media, to use in the event of national or international crisis.

If you&#39;re in charge of something -- a work team, a class, a marketing effort -- then you need to be able to adjust and respond when circumstances change. And this is one part of that.
