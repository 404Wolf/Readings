I have a long relationship with digital media. I’ve been blogging for decades. I’ve been a news junkie forever. And I started a startup in the real-time and historical content analytics space (Parse.ly) that ended up shipping [a widely-used product](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;parse.ly&#x2F;) in the industry.

What’s more, Parse.ly’s network-wide data (billions upon billions of online news reading sessions) was used to understand the media industry from 2011-2021, via various (aggregated and anonymized) data compilations and reports in partnership with organizations like Axios and Pew Research. This was one of my favorite studies, on [the shape of different page visit lengths, using engaged time (PDF)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.parse.ly&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;6&#x2F;2022&#x2F;09&#x2F;Redefining-Bounce-Rate-with-Engaged-Time.pdf).

Summary of the “engaged time” spent on single news articles across 1.6 billion news reading sessions from the Jan. 2017 – Jun. 2017 period in the Parse.ly network.

Parse.ly [was acquired by Automattic](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techmeme.com&#x2F;210208&#x2F;p12#a210208p12), the creators of WordPress.com and WPVIP, in February 2021\. WordPress is probably the most widely used content management system in digital media, powering over 40% of the web.

Lately, I’ve moved back into the role of “mere observer” of the media industry while I work on a new project in the land of cloud dev tools. But these 5 essays from my archive give a good sense of my views on media from the last few years:
