I&#39;ve been meaning to write more but I only have some loose ideas bouncing around. Nothing feels like a coherent story I can turn into a blog post. I don&#39;t want to end up not writing anything so I am going to throw these loose observations in one post and see how I like that.

## The Artist&#39;s Way is amazing

Reading [&quot;The Artist&#39;s Way&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The%5FArtist%27s%5FWay) has been a transformational experience for me. I understand so much better now how I get in the way of myself when writing music. I don&#39;t know where to begin to explain but one good example is that instead of trying to control and steer myself in a certain direction (&quot;I want to make an XYZ kind of song that sounds like artist ABC&quot;) it works much better if I let the music happen as I write it (&quot;I don&#39;t know how this song will turn out but I am going to bring it to life to the best of my abilities&quot;).

## The book &quot;The Creative Habit&quot; is not for me

A friend recommended Twyla Tharp&#39;s book [&quot;The Creative Habit: Learn It And Use It For Life&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twylatharp.org&#x2F;works&#x2F;creative-habit-learn-it-and-use-it-life) to me. The author seems to be very hard on herself and she tries to shame and goad the reader into doing the same. An example of the tone of the book:

&gt; I hope you&#39;ve been to the ballet and seen a dance company in action on stage. If you haven&#39;t, shame on you; that&#39;s like admitting you&#39;ve never read a novel or strolled through a museum or heard a Beethoven symphony live.

Being talked to like that just isn&#39;t motivating for me.

## The book &quot;The Creative Act&quot; has grown on me

I wrote about [this book by Rick Rubin two months ago](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.jacobvosmaer.nl&#x2F;0024-creativity-books&#x2F;#creative-act) and I didn&#39;t like the tone at the time. Now that I have learned more and now that I have &quot;The Creative Habit&quot; to compare it with Rubin&#39;s book has grown on me. His attitude towards creativity and his observations about things that work and don&#39;t work align with what I now believe.

I found this book nowhere near as helpful as The Artist&#39;s Way but it&#39;s still nice to nod in agreement with the things someone with so much experience is writing.

## Naming songs is hard

It is important to me to publish my songs in some way and to do that I need to give them names. But I write instrumental music; there are no lyrics in my songs. I cannot just let some words from the lyrics be the title.

It has happened several times to me now that a song seems finished (it&#39;s recorded and all), I want to publish it, but I get stuck for days just trying to come up with a name that feels good.

I don&#39;t even think the names I come up with are that great. But I wouldn&#39;t be comfortable using randomly generated pure nonsense either. I am bemused by the fact that this part of the process (naming) is so difficult.

## I made a video showing how I write music

You can watch it [here](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;9olxSnaXj1U). In that video I am doing improvisational writing which became the first half of the song [CKS is JSON](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soundcloud.com&#x2F;collector-current&#x2F;cks-is-json). (Yes, it took me days to decide on that name.)

It was really fun to record this video and see what actually happens when I write music. It was also fun to sit down with the camera rolling and say to myself &quot;I am going to be creative now&quot; and then it actually happened. I actually did this twice that day. The first time the sound of the video wasn&#39;t good enough to share it, but the first writing session of that day became the second half of the song.

One of the lessons I&#39;ve drawn from The Artist&#39;s Way is that creativity is essentially abundant. If you invite the ideas they will come. Even if you are recording a video of yoursef while being way out of your comfort zone.
