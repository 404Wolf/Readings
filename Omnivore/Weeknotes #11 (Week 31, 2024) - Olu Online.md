* been thinking more than doing this week which i think (there it goes again, the infernal thinking!) usually i&#39;d take to be a bad thing, but i know it was a very busy week household management wise (cleaning and admin, etc). trying to give myself a little grace. üôèüèø
* continuing [alphabet superset](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alphabetsuperset.com&#x2F;) after a long hiatus. the creator of the challenge is still working on his so I&#39;m allowing myself to not be a perfectionist about it. draft of the next one, on [jargon](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.olu.online&#x2F;jargon) is up but not complete, hopefully obviously. coming up with for life-centric, justice&#x2F;flourishing-centered topics for k is weirdly hard but I&#39;ll think of something.
* i was catching up on lu&#39;s blog in the middle of writing this ‚Äî no YOU have executive dysfunction issues ‚Äî and she recently posted about [how you shouldn&#39;t ask for feedback on things you haven&#39;t released a draft of](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.todepond.com&#x2F;wikiblogarden&#x2F;academia&#x2F;open&#x2F;garden&#x2F;), so i&#39;ll pretend that&#39;s the reason i am posting more to the notes blog. you can&#39;t stop me!
* came across a series on a blog about bloggers due to [anne sturdivant](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;manuelmoreale.com&#x2F;pb-anne-sturdivant) recommending me as a blog to read! i&#39;m touched especially as i have done nothing but weeknotes and [hopes](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;24-hopes-for-2024&#x2F;) so far this year but it&#39;s funny timing; i had been thinking about picking up on alphabet superset for a while but this was the push i needed! [anne](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;weblog.anniegreens.lol&#x2F;) is also doing [#100DaysToOffload](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;100daystooffload.com&#x2F;), another challenge i&#39;m going to try!
* a friend was asking about project management stuff I do and I think it&#39;s part of why I struggle with big projects like long form video. aka &quot;what project management?&quot; is my answer lol. I know I&#39;d love a system that accounted for dependencies and let me block tasks until another task was done. I feel like [amazing marvin](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;weeknotes-11-week-31-2024&#x2F;amazingmarvin.com) probably has it in its box of tricks but finding it a lot for my current minimalist approach; might have to write something myself üò©
* as i&#39;ve sort of said on my [now](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;now) page, i have discovered i have a burning fear of being on camera on some level. i thought i was putting off making short videos cos I was worried about being boring or being wrong but it&#39;s garden variety stage fright (booo. boooo!). i think (more booing erupts) that practice, taking it slow, and recording things but not immediately&#x2F;ever posting them might help? but we shall see! worried it will go the way of chess and i&#39;ll just be forever put off it, but i know it&#39;s not good for anxiety to let it fester. dragging my fear out into the light, like god intended!
* I remember why I was on Lu&#39;s site now; I am loathe to create a new idea about how habit apps should work, and thus a new habit app, when a billion of the bloody things exist. They are mostly interchangeable and will not have been built by me though, so maybe it&#39;s not so much [a new idea](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.todepond.com&#x2F;wikiblogarden&#x2F;my-wikiblogarden&#x2F;no-more-ideas&#x2F;) but a new implementation that will teach me a bunch of things? Whatever, we&#39;ll see.
