* better late than never on this one!
* this week has been pretty empty of writing and internet and tech stuff, been a very afk&#x2F;meatspace week which has been nice in a lot of ways.
* finished planning my quarter on the 1st which felt auspicious; the only one I&#39;m gonna share of the four is that I want to create more online. I like doing weeknotes so will keep those up, but trying to ramp up my output on [all my social media](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;contact) and here cos I feel like I have been in input&#x2F;consume mode for too long.
* turns out there&#39;s no consensus on what length of video essay is best for consistently actually completing the things. Almost as if it&#39;s completely subjective.
* starting [another YouTube channel](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@OluOutlines) about planning&#x2F;reviewing&#x2F;outlining your life, no posts yet but excited about it. Need to work out if I&#39;m going to have a public facing goals list and my private goals for video recording reasons lol.
* might write&#x2F;record&#x2F;etc a piece about the blurring and crumbling boundaries of public and private online; maybe that can be my second TikTok.
* also wondering about a public facing content calendar&#x2F;WIP on my [notes](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;olu.online&#x2F;weeknotes-7-week-27-2024&#x2F;notes.olu.online) site, but I think i need some kind of commenting or upvoting system if i do that to make it useful to me for planning purposes.
* stalled a bit on my habits website snapback; i&#39;m struggling with [Finch](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finchcare.com&#x2F;) at the minute and assume that all apps&#x2F;websites eventually get annoying or intrusive to a lot of people. I know I should just build it for what i want and what i need now and not worry about hypothetical users lol, but easier said than done.
