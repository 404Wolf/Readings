The aim of this brief note is to distill Taylor’s theorem to its essence and expose its source—the _noncommutativity_ of differentiation and integration. I make no great claim to originality. But I think the fundamental role of noncommutativity has never been made quite explicit in standard treatments of Taylor’s theorem.
