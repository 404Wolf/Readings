Gets at some important points â€” in particular, pointing out the fundamental issue with Title IX resulting in a process where universities are more concerned with protecting the university than protecting victims of sexual assault.

The discussion of the history of campus protests was interesting, as was hearing more details about the infamous UC Davis pepper-spraying cop (I grew up in Davis, which was for many years most well known for this, but I was too young when it happened to really be paying attention to many of the details beyond the shocking photo)
