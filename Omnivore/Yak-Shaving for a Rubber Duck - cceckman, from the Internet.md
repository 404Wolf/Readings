I’m a professional programmer and a casual crocheter. A few years ago, I made the most_idiomatic_[1](#fn:1) project possible for a programmer: a hoodie for a rubber duck, made from yak wool.

## What? Why?

## Why a duck?

There’s a debugging technique called [rubber-duck debugging](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rubber%5Fduck%5Fdebugging). My phrasing:

&gt; Put a rubber duck on your desk.
&gt; 
&gt; Go through your code step-by-step, explaining it in terms that the duck understands.
&gt; 
&gt; By the time you get to the end, you’ll realize why the code doesn’t work.

Of course, it doesn’t have to be a rubber duck: I’ll often use a journal or a [peer](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pair%5Fprogramming) instead of an inanimate object. But I still keep the duck on my desk.[2](#fn:2)

I use rubber-duck debugging for computer programs, but I hear from [Edie](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edieeckman.com&#x2F;) that it also works for people programs.[3](#fn:3)

## Why yak wool?

Another idiom in programming circles is [_yak-shaving_](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;yak%5Fshaving):

&gt; …yak shaving is what you are doing when you’re doing some stupid, fiddly little task that bears no obvious relationship to what you’re supposed to be working on, but yet a chain of twelve causal relations links what you’re doing to the original meta-task.

From [Jeremy H. Brown](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.csail.mit.edu&#x2F;gsb&#x2F;old-archive&#x2F;gsb-archive&#x2F;gsb2000-02-11.html) 

The example I learned goes something like this:[4](#fn:4)

* I need to take the bar exam, but it requires a Windows computer, and we only have Linux around the house.
* To install Windows, I need an 8GB USB stick, but I don’t have one.
* I could borrow one from Chris, but I had promised to knit his kid a sweater and haven’t, so it would be awkward to ask.
* The kid is (somehow) allergic to acrylic _and_ sheep wool _and_ alpaca … but not yaks?
* There isn’t yak wool for sale,[5](#fn:5) but there is a farm nearby that will let me shave a yak for a reasonable amount of money.

So… I’m shaving a yak to take the bar exam.

There’s a nuance in the usage I’m familiar with: the yak-shaving is _not strictly necessary_ for the original task. I don’t really need to shave the yak – I could just get a USB stick from the store – but shaving the yak lets me put off installing Windows.

## Why a hoodie?

Standard hacker garb.

## Why a yellow duck?

I didn’t [spend a lot of time](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;bikeshedding) [picking a color](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.freebsd.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;books&#x2F;faq&#x2F;#bikeshed-painting).[6](#fn:6)

## Production details

[![A rubber duck wearing a gray crocheted yak-wool hoodie, seen from behind. Some additional rubber ducks look on in envy.](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app&#x2F;0x0,sOdJTaUOD6iEgo_g5M2idgMJKQ7-v49dYT5oa04Vfuv4&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cceckman.com&#x2F;writing&#x2F;yak-and-duck&#x2F;rear.webp)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cceckman.com&#x2F;writing&#x2F;yak-and-duck&#x2F;rear.webp) 

I made the body and hood by freehand single-crochet in the round. I made the front pocket separately, and (clumsily) attached it after the fact.

According to my records,[7](#fn:7) I used [mYak](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;myak.it&#x2F;) Baby Yak Medium yarn, in the “Oatmeal” colorway. (That’s not an affiliate link; I have no relation with mYak.)

If you’re interested in crochet, I _of course_ recommend [Edie Eckman](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edieeckman.com&#x2F;)’s courses, books, and [videos](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;EdieEckman). (Yes, we are related.)

1. Yes, I’m abusing this term to mean “full of idioms” rather than “adhering to idioms”. [↩︎](#fnref:1)
2. There’s another “duck” idiom in programming, [duck typing](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Duck%5Ftyping), from the idiom “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck.” As far as I’m aware these idioms arose independently. [↩︎](#fnref:2)
3. i.e. knit and crochet patterns, which are written in an imperative, bytecode-style [language](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stitch-maps.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;knitspeak&#x2F;). [↩︎](#fnref:3)
