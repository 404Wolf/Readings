It&#39;s the First day of my batch today. We ~~haven&#39;t had the kickoff meeting yet~~ but I&#39;m taking some time to set intentions for the week.

This week is inevitably dedicated to figuring things out, and I don&#39;t think I should expect to get a lot of programming done, but I do still want to set some goals.

* Figure out the shape of my days: I&#39;m 6 hours ahead NY time, so core hours fall between 5-11pm. Can I get some work done in the morning? How can I ensure I&#39;m productive in the evening? How do other remote recurses do it?
* Figure out the shape of the full batch. I have some project ideas, but I&#39;m going back and forth between depth and breadth. I&#39;m hoping that after intro chats and meeting other recurses this week I&#39;ll have a better idea of what&#39;s possible &#x2F; realistic.
* I would still like to get some small project done. A big explicit goal for me is to build shipping muscle, meaning once I set out to do something, finish it, write about it and present it. I would like to have something small and presentable by the end of the week.

A couple of meta concerns I have:

* How can i make sure I get a healthy amount of movement in? Given the timezone difference, I won&#39;t get a lot of time to skate&#x2F;surf&#x2F;bmx in the next 6 weeks. I&#39;ve grabbed a jump rope, yoga mat and some resistance bands to make sure I get some workouts during the day.
* What&#39;s a good ratio of blogging to coding? I want to use blogging as an accountability method, but I know how easy it is to spend way too long on a piece of writing...

On that note, piece of writing done. Time to get to work.
