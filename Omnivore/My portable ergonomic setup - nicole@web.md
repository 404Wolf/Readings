**Monday, June 3, 2024**

In 2022, I developed nerve pain in my arms. It came on quickly, and it was bad: I couldn&#39;t drive, I couldn&#39;t type, and at the worst I couldn&#39;t pick up our kids. That episode spontaneously resolved after a couple of months, but flareups happen occasionally. One guaranteed trigger is my laptop: if I use it as, well, _a laptop_, then I&#39;ll have pain for a few days from less than half an hour of usage.

Despite all that, I&#39;m more confident than ever that I&#39;ll be productive as a programmer for decades to come. That confidence comes _from_ having to deal with these issues. They&#39;ve forced me to learn some accessibility tech and get&#x2F;create some equipment so that I can program without pain.

Here&#39;s my setup, as of 2024\. This is a snapshot, as it will surely change over time as my needs and abilities change. I hope that this can be useful for folks out there struggling with the same things I did. There&#39;s some background to go through first, then a rundown of how I made it portable.

## Finding a non-portable keyboard my body accepts

I love mechanical keyboards. The tactility of the switches, the sounds, it&#39;s a wonderful part of interfacing with a computer. I got about half a year of that after my nerve issues resolved before the pain returned.

When it returned, I did some research on different ergonomic options. There are a lot of good options out there, and they&#39;re all expensive to experiment with! I ended up choosing the [Keyboardio Model 100](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.keyboard.io&#x2F;products&#x2F;model-100) for a few reasons. It was highly recommended by folks with similar issues, it is a split keyboard, it supports tenting[1](#tenting), and the keys are column-staggered to better match how your fingers actually work.

This keyboard has been a joy. The palm keys and thumb clusters are wonderful, and using my palm&#x2F;thumb for layer switching is really intuitive and allows me to avoid far stretches. I have a lot of special characters (like some of the programmers&#39; punctuation, &#x60;{}[]&#x60;) on that layer, plus mouse functionality and arrow keys. The thumb cluster is all easily accessible with a sweeping motion of my thumb. Using it with a small degree of tenting from the default kit resolved my pain again! (Yes, my toe is getting sore from kicking that can a lot.)

I oscillated between using it split or together for a while. Now I exclusively use it split, but I have a picture from early on where it&#39;s not split. I like having it split, especially since a coffee cup fits between them, but when I was still figuring out portability, clipping them together seemed appealing.

I take this keyboard with me when I travel. It&#39;s flown from Philadelphia to Seattle, it&#39;s driven across multiple states, and it took a train to NYC. It&#39;s wonderful—and it takes up a _lot_ of space in my luggage.

I kept relapsing by using my laptop as a laptop because it&#39;s so convenient, and I don&#39;t want to _always_ be at my desk. So I had to figure out how to use this keyboard portably if I want to be able to type for decades more[2](#decades).

## Figuring out how to make this portable

I made a lapdesk of sorts for my keyboard, with a laptop riser on it. It was big and bulky, but I could use my laptop in our living room, which was a minor success. But since it was so heavy and bulky, I couldn&#39;t leave the house with it.

This came to a head with Never Graduate Week, the annual alumni event for [the Recurse Center](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recurse.com&#x2F;). It&#39;s a gathering of computer nerds, and I wouldn&#39;t be able to take my laptop up and use it? No, no, it was time to fix that. And I realized this a week before my train to NYC._Tick tock[3](#tiktok)._

My design goals were to make something that:

* fits in my backpack
* supports tenting my split keyboard
* holds my laptop screen at a reasonable height
* takes moments to setup

I started by revisiting some posts about other people&#39;s ergonomic setups. In particular, I found a lot of inspiration from [Peter Lyon&#39;s laptop tray](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peterlyons.com&#x2F;problog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;ergothink-t420-laptop-tray&#x2F;) and from [Laura Langdon&#39;s keyboard setup](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lauralangdon.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;my-ultra-ergo-keyboard-setup&#x2F;). Peter&#39;s post showed a clever way to get the screen height up: with a 180-degree laptop hinge, you can stick the laptop in a vertical slot and it is its own riser to a decent ergonomic height. This comes with big weight savings, since you need a couple of ounces of wood instead of much more material for a &quot;real&quot; laptop riser. Laura&#39;s post showed me a clever way to mount the keyboards themselves using Z tripod mounts!

My design here was not sophisticated, and I took an approach of figuring it out as I went (as I do with many practical workshop projects). I went in with basically just the constraint of dimensions, since it had to fit in my backpack, and available material. I purchased some [Z tripod mounts](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B0CQS7FPKX&#x2F;ref&#x3D;ppx%5Fyo%5Fdt%5Fb%5Fsearch%5Fasin%5Ftitle?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;th&#x3D;1) for tenting the keyboards, and the rest of the hardware was scrap wood I had in my workshop from other projects.

The first thing I did was get the base cut down to the largest size that would fit in my backpack. It&#39;s harder to put wood back together than to cut off more later on. Then I used a router and straight edge to cut some slots for the tripod mounts to attach to. There are two sets of these, because I forgot to account for the keyboard&#39;s USB cable the first time... or maybe it was just a clever way to get the whole thing lighter. Who knows!

After that, I attached some wood for the back half of the laptop slot. I didn&#39;t want to plan and iterate as much as Peter did, so I opted to make an adjustable slot rather than go for a precise fit. There&#39;s a fixed piece of wood across the back, a wood strap on the front, and some bolts allow tightening or loosening it to put in and take out the laptop. It&#39;s reasonably easy to get the laptop out—under 15 seconds in either direction—and the laptop is _very_ secure in there when it&#39;s tightened in.

The nice-to-have thing I added was a USB hub with power pass-through, so I can use one cable to attach all my peripherals to my laptop (currently, a mouse that I rarely use and my keyboard). I can also use one cable to attach all my desk peripherals, like my webcam and monitor, when I sit there. And because the tray is so small and pretty light, I just use it at my desk, too. I switch up the position I use it in, so sometimes it sits on my desk and sometimes I have it in my lap.

And it _did_ achieve the primary design goal of being portable. I&#39;ve used it on an Amtrak train, in a church basement for a chess tournament, and all around my house. It&#39;s going to get a lot of miles traveling around with me.

![](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app&#x2F;0x0,sBCoZ2oR5agt24we7TMZb_8jGwB07WF5NORvcHvMREE8&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ntietz.com&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;keyboard-6.8002646770a52aeb.jpg)

Not bad for a three hour prototype[4](#not-counting)! Of course, it&#39;s still &quot;just a prototype,&quot; so like all prototypes, it&#39;s going to be used as the production model for _far_ too long.

As an added bonus: social interactions! Most people completely ignore the lady with the weird contraption in public, so you don&#39;t have to worry about your Amtrak neighbor talking to you. Unless you happen to sit next to a Recurser, or another computer nerd. Because let me tell you, there is no better conversation starter than this thing among RC folks. The whole time I was up there, I would hear variations on &quot;oooh what is this, tell me about it!&quot; It was wonderful.

## Coding by voice

Of course, my arms gave out so totally in the past that I&#39;m not assuming they&#39;ll always be here to write code for me. What&#39;s a girl to do? Find other input mechanisms, that&#39;s what!

During my first major round of RSI pain, I learned how to use [Talon](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talonvoice.com&#x2F;), software for controlling your computer entirely by voice. It&#39;s pretty [amazing software](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xeiaso.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;voice-control-talon&#x2F;), and it gives me so much confidence knowing that it&#39;s available when I need it. During that first round of pain, I got back to where I could &quot;type&quot; at about half my previous keyboard speed. That made it not really a limiting factor, though the cognitive overhead of it was still high.

The thing is, my arms send warning shots sometimes. &quot;Nicole, remember that we can hurt or fall asleep _whenever we want_.&quot; So Talon is coming back into my workflow. I&#39;m not going to code by voice all the time, but I&#39;m going to work up to quarter- to half-time Talon usage. I want to hedge and have more input mechanisms.

Besides, a microphone is a lot more portable than my whole contraption here.

Right now as I get back into it, I&#39;m experimenting with using a bluetooth IEM that has a microphone in it. It&#39;s not really the recommended setup, but so far it&#39;s been having good accuracy for me, so I&#39;ll go with it for now! A wireless mic is _really_ nice to have with Talon, because you can move around freely, away from your computer even, and continue to enter text.

I&#39;ll never forget the first time I wrote code with my whole desk empty in front of me, available for coffee and notebooks... &lt;3

If you have a rad portable ergonomic setup, I&#39;d love to hear about it! And if you see any obvious improvements to my setup, please let me know. I want to be writing code as long as I am alive, and that means either dying young or coding into late life. I&#39;d much prefer the latter.

This was a new term for me when I started this research! Tenting a keyboard is you tilt the halves of the keyboard up (so they look sort of like a tent), which should make it so you don&#39;t have to rotate your forearms, or not as much.

[↩](#tenting%5Fref)

2

I have over 30 years of jobs left in me before the standard US retirement age, but I&#39;m not banking my career on the assumption that I&#39;ll be typing for that entire time. That&#39;s why I&#39;m also preparing for other contingencies, like using [Talon](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talonvoice.com&#x2F;)!

This is the sound of the clock ticking on my opportunity to enjoy computer use around other computer people, not to be confused with the app that&#39;s been deemed a national security threat for... reasons.

5

If you have a name for this category of device that holds both the keyboard and the laptop, let me know! Serious _and_ outrageous suggestions are equally welcome.

This doesn&#39;t count the time spent acquiring the skills and tools to be able to quickly prototype this, which took the past decade.
