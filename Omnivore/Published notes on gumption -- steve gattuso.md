 Published notes on gumption

 Published on Mar 11th, 2024.

I was spending some time reading through my personal wiki during a flight home the other day and stumbled upon some notes around _gumption_ that I took while reading Robert Pirsig’s _Zen in the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_. It’s been years since I read the book, but I’m realizing I’ve incorporated a lot of these ideas into my work having forgotten the origin of them. These discoveries are one of the many joys that come from keeping a personal wiki!

I’m publishing a cleaned up version of my notes just in case someone else might find it useful (or maybe to inspire another reader of the book). Here’s a teaser:

&gt; Gumption is a term used to describe enthusiasm for your work. It’s the psychological gasoline that keeps you going.
&gt; 
&gt; Progress on a project is impossible without gumption, but when properly nurtured progress is impossible to avoid. The monitoring and preservation of gumption is the most important aspect of work.
