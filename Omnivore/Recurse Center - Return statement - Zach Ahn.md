I spent six weeks at a free (and unpaid) programming retreat at the [Recurse Center](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recurse.com&#x2F;) (RC) at the beginning of this year. I had a really good time.

Before I continue, I want to point out that it felt like a special time. RC has been on my radar for many years, and I wanted to attend almost as soon as I heard about it. It’s a huge investment (and risk) to spend six weeks learning, and not working. I was very aware of this opportunity cost, and this pushed me to make the most of my time.

## The six weeks

One of RC’s core tenets is self-guided learning. The staff there hosts sessions and provide guidance to encourage everyone to think about what they want to do.

I have a lot of experience with Ruby and Rails, and these have been my go-to tools for as long as I can remember. So I wanted to stretch myself by working on things I was unfamiliar with.

I decided to focus on native app development using SwiftUI and AI. I started off by working on my own iOS apps and joining a small study group watching an [AI course](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;karpathy.ai&#x2F;zero-to-hero.html). And although I also wrote some Rust, JavaScript, Python, and even a tiny bit of Ruby, my goals remained pretty consistent throughout my entire time there.

There’s definitely a tradeoff between “focus” and “open discovery”. I made very effective use of my time at RC, but I feel like I missed out on some cool opportunities. There was another study group working through the [Cryptopals](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptopals.com&#x2F;) exercises, and though I tried to join partway through and catch up, I realized that that was an unrealistic goal. I’m sure I would have enjoyed it had I joined earlier, but I’m also sure I wouldn’t have learned as much about building iOS apps.

There’s also a huge tradeoff between attending remotely vs in person. Though I live fairly close to the hub, I caught a cold and participated remotely for the first three weeks of my batch. I found that working remotely was more productive, and that working in-person was more fulfilling—it was easier for me to connect with people when face to face. (But my case was probably more extreme than others. Since I had a sore throat, I avoided joining calls so I wouldn’t have to talk too much.)

One highlight for me was “Impossible Stuff Day”, an event where we optionally spend a day working on “something that feels totally impossible right now”. I spent that day working on a lexer&#x2F;parser, which was something I read about but hadn’t ever worked on. I also really enjoyed the last day of my batch where a few of us just chatted, played board games, and stayed out really late.

## Life as an alum

In a way, there’s very little difference between your last day in-batch and your first day out-of-batch since we’re welcome to participate as usual. I got pretty busy pretty quickly, so I wasn’t as present as I planned. But was able to join for my second Impossible Stuff Day, and even a for two-week study group that looked into the safety of generative AI.

I found RC’s career services to be helpful. I got some good tips related to my resume and to interviewing in general. And they seem to recruit for some cool partner companies!

In a small way, RC was life changing. I’m more open to working on things I’ve never done before. I can write small iOS apps now. And while I always loved programming, I think love it even more now after meeting people with such diverse interests and enthusiasm for their projects.
