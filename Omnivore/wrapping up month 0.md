_Brian Hicks, March 4, 2024_

Well, it&#39;s March 4 already, so it&#39;s about time to wrap up the first month with a short post. What&#39;d I get done this month? Well:

* I have a Kubernetes cluster ready to run all the workloads from my other experiments.
* That cluster is running my blog and associated services, plus some other smaller sites.
* I&#39;ve got deployments all automated and ready to go.

There is some work left undone, though, of course:

* The cluster isn&#39;t very well hardened yet. I&#39;m pretty close there, though: I really only need to set up an alerting system for policy violations and security events and it&#39;ll be done.
* I&#39;m still running [git.bytes.zone](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.bytes.zone&#x2F;) on the old infrastructure. I&#39;m giving the few folks who are still using it some time to move their repos off.

Overall, I feel pretty good about this. I&#39;ve learned a lot and I have something nice to show for it! On to next month!
