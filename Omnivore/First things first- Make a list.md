I am a big fan of Making A List, whether on paper or digitally.[1](#footnote-1) 

As taught to me by [Chuck](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;futurestatesband.ca&#x2F;%29)[2](#footnote-2), **the most important thing about a to-do list is that the first item on it is ‚ÄúMake a list‚Äù**. Then, when you‚Äôve finished adding tasks to your list, you can check it off immediately. Bam, [dopamine](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hannahilea.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;driven-developments&#x2F;). Happy day, you‚Äôre already partly done with your list! Look at you, so much progress already! My notebook is filled with (partially-completed üòÖ) daily to-do lists, each of which starts with ‚Äúmake a list‚Äù.

The one type of list I don‚Äôt regularly start this way is the [punch lists](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Punch%5Flist) that I often add to pull requests (PRs). (Pull requests are proposals to merge a set of changes into a set of existing documents, e.g., source code.) PR punch lists both keep me on task and let my reviewers know what subtasks I intentionally considered‚Äîand, implicitly, what I did not. (Are you requesting a non-trivial review from me? Bonus points if you include a punch list!)

I‚Äôve also found that adding a punch list to a [Github PR template](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;communities&#x2F;using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests&#x2F;creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository) helps improve review turnaround time and reduces review friction, and sets newer contributors up to succeed more quickly.

1\. This is a different skill than the skill of completing tasks, mind‚Ä¶[‚Ü©](#footnote-1-ref)

2\. One of the most valuable things I learned in grad school![‚Ü©](#footnote-2-ref)
