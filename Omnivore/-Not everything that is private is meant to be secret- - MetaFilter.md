From 2003: [Danny O&#39;Brien wrote](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oblomovka.com&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2003&#x2F;10&#x2F;13&#x2F;the-register&#x2F;):

&gt; ...we have conversations in public, in private, and in secret. All three are quite separate. The public is what we say to a crowd; the private is what we chatter amongst ourselves, when free from the demands of the crowd; and the secret is what we keep from everyone but our confidant. Secrecy implies intrigue, implies you have something to hide. Being private doesn’t....There are only two registers on the Net; public and secret.

with further thoughts on implications for conversation and norms.

&gt; No matter how constant a person you are, no matter how unwavering your beliefs, something you say in the private register will sound horrific, dismissive, egotistical or trite when blazoned on the front page of the Daily Mirror. This is the context that we are quoted out of.....
&gt; 
&gt; On the net, you have public, or you have secrets. The private intermediate sphere, with its careful buffering. is shattered. E-mails are forwarded verbatim. IRC transcripts, with throwaway comments, are preserved forever. You talk to your friends online, you talk to the world.....
&gt; 
&gt; There are only two registers on the Net; public and secret. In the public sphere, everything you say is for everyone. Talk in the secret register, and you have something to hide.
&gt; 
&gt; And this is what the end of privacy means. It means the end of the _private_ register. Not everything that is private is meant to be secret, meant to be hidden. It’s just not intended to be public. That grey area is fading, and soon it will be gone.

MeFites have brought up this piece when discussing the topic ([2022](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metafilter.com&#x2F;197470&#x2F;Your-Favorite-X-is-Problematic#8333143), [2015](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metafilter.com&#x2F;146973&#x2F;How-One-Stupid-Tweet-Blew-Up-Justine-Saccos-Life#5936250), [also 2015](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metafilter.com&#x2F;146973&#x2F;How-One-Stupid-Tweet-Blew-Up-Justine-Saccos-Life#5935257)) but I believe no one&#39;s ever linked to it in a front page post before.
