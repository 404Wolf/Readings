* crap, late as anything again.
* my housemates&#x2F;chosen fam are&#x2F;were away for this week and until august so mostly luxuriating in the quiet in the house, and marvelling at my brain&#39;s ability to not ruminate even when there&#39;s ample time for it. apparently, my brain only ruminates when it wants to!
* speaking of rumination, i am really shook that i can work for so long on a project and then get full of doubt (and maybe fear?) about what i&#39;m doing to the point i need to stop working on it for at least a while. The &quot;who isn&#39;t online&quot; stuff maybe will get uploaded as a note for now but I feel like it&#39;s become a fact dumping ground, which is not very entertaining or interesting to me, so it&#39;s being parked.
* i still need to work out how you have milestones and goals around open-ended projects, aka ones i&#39;m unsure how long they will take and&#x2F;or what form&#x2F;shape&#x2F;length the output will have. I know you can make input goals - i will work X hours on Y until Z - but is that all the control you can have?
* since [YNAB](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ynab.com&#x2F;) are once again increasing their prices i looked into [Actual Budget](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;actualbudget.org&#x2F;) but i think it&#39;s too much work for me, which I should have known from the jump. i am not blogging from a platform i self-rolled, know thyself. it looks good if you&#39;re happy with the workflow and want to save $109 a year though, i will admit.
* pretty head empty week in all honesty. been going to therapy. been trying to [exercise&#x2F;move more](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amysnellingpersonaltraining.squarespace.com&#x2F;) and [stretch](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aadamrichardson.com&#x2F;) with mixed success but i have enjoyed what i have done! been trying to cook more with grudging success. i feel very grateful for my life and excited to see what&#39;s coming up.
