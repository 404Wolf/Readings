I know I am not the only one who wants to know how everything works. After all, there are plenty of shows dedicated to the manufacturing processes of pretty much everything. I _really_ like knowing how things work. As a kid, I would regularly take apart random things (think toys, small electronics), look at them, and put them back together. They usually worked after I put them back together.

Sometimes, the desire to know how things work goes beyond just curiosity. I bought a car not too long ago. A semi-cheap [2000 Mercedes S500](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mercedes-Benz%5FS-Class%5F%28W220%29), which I currently use every day. I have had a driver&#39;s license for a few years and have driven my mom&#39;s car on a couple of occasions. Now, I have my own car. An object that has tons of moving parts and electronics. I didn&#39;t know how it really worked, which bothered me.

Anyway, I studied using some books and lots of YouTube and now have a rudimentary understanding of the basics of a car. It turned out to be pretty fascinating! Unfortunately, finding a job in software engineering has become very very difficult for a fresh college grad like myself.

However, that gives me the perfect opportunity to go do random things like being a mechanic! That&#39;s what I decided to do, at least until I can get a job more aligned with my intended career. I&#39;ve started working part-time at an auto repair shop that is very willing to teach and be patient with me. I plan to do whatever they expect me to as long as they pay me and I get to learn more about cars. Quite a bit of what they expect me to do is IT stuff, since I&#39;m good with computers and all. It&#39;s okay though. I need to give some of my skills to take some of theirs.

To help me retain my skills and reflect on what I learn while working there, I plan to keep a journal where I just write down what I&#39;ve learned for the day. Here it is.

### 6&#x2F;15&#x2F;24 (10 hours)

* On some cars, you have an accessory belt with no tensioner. This means you have to stretch the belt around the pulley. There&#39;s no way you&#39;re managing that without a bit of trickery. I found [a trick on YouTube](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;diJ1mXW2WOY) involving 2 zip ties.
* The push-start ignition switch is a bitch to find and you will look like an idiot trying to get most modern cars started.
* It is easy to have more debt from [Snap-on](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snapon.com&#x2F;) tools than money in your bank account.
* Common sense goes a long way.
* Parts are cheap. Labor is expensive.

### 6&#x2F;17&#x2F;24 (2 hours)

* If you take the lugs off a wheel, and it&#39;s stuck to the hub, you may have to hit the tire with a hammer from the back.
* Rotating your tires (i.e. swapping the front two with the back two) frequently will get you a lot more life out of them and save you some money.

You&#39;ve reached the end. I plan to regularly update this page. Come back or [shoot me a message](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;lloti&#x2F;) if you&#39;d like to read more!
