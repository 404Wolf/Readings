Was supposed to give a talk and workshop on **Interfaces for Data Consent** at the [**Re-Imagining Cryptography and Privacy (ReCAP) Workshop**](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;recapworkshop.online&#x2F;) last month! Sadly came down with a virus and was unable to attend. I did compile some resources into a short guide that I’d like to share.

“**How can clear, effective, and fluid interfaces for consent be built into digital public infrastructure and data governance?**

Some examples of cultural frameworks and interfaces for consent include: Betty Martin’s Wheel of Consent; informed consent in medicine; University Title IX Policies of Affirmative Consent; Sociocracy’s “Consent Decision-Making”; consensus decision making; opt-in vs. opt-out; consent profiles; GDPR cookie consent interfaces; Creative Commons licensing; open-source licensing, GPL3, and copyleft; and more!

As we translate cultural frameworks for consent into interactable consent interfaces, how can we implement privacy and cryptography tools to provide backend **consent guarantees**?”
